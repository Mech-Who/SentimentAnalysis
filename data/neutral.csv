Netflix Apni sabhi Video ko sabhi Bhashao me Dikha pata to Sayad or bhi Jyada Mazedaar Hota...
Good collection of shows and films with some nice original content. Everything good except all details of credit card asked in advance with advance permission to deduct charges every month without asking. The NETFLIX is very costly...but its a worthy of money.....
Good
all are good but many animes or movies are not provided in Hindi language.please Provide animes like Naruto in Hindi as soon as possible.
Not impressed
Provide Details About What You Are Updating In The App.
Content wise all good. But while you watch movies at night in phone the in app brightness controller dont allow you decrease the brightness to lowest. Which can be done thru phone brightness controller after exit the netflix app. Quite annoying.. Already complained to cs netflix but not resolved since no solution.
It would have been better if all series and movies from other countries are available globally. Some series are only available on specific countries and it's saddening.
Why do you not show that this app. Cost $6.99 vs Letting people download the app. only to learn it's not free.
Whyyyy please quit removing TV / movie shows
"Its good, but new shows are slow and far between unless you're in america...might be time to switch"
"I like Netflix because it has alot of shows and movies other watching apps dont have. and it's a really developed app. Which it also helps you find shows you would maybe watch depending on what your have watched. Although 3 downsides is that that its not cheap, they deleted sharing Netflix passwords, and their latest update. but atleast the app is great, enjoyable, and most importantly, very addicting."
You can wach what ever you want and my only ichu with it is you have to spend money

for last year have had problems. Netflix telling me bad internet connection. Netflix is the only streaming I have problems with. my family pays 100% of the Netflix bill. I expect 100% service 100% of the time. not only 100% on non peak hours and maybe 45% on peak hours. should be a law past if you can't give 100% of what customers pay for you shouldn't be able to add anymore customers.

Will not let Ms unstall this app please help me unstall this app so my phone can start acting correctly
I like it has anime one piece and the stuff u can imagine but I realized Netflix skipped over 500 episodes can you please fix it?????
I like Netflix in general but the app is very frustrating that it defaults for a lot of shows to English with audio description. I don't have that as a selection but it does it anyway. Every episode as well. It doesn't save my preferences. Samsung S22+
I really enjoy Netflix. But why is Netflix confused in top listing some of movies or series really worst rated movies or series on top after watching ther will be no thrill no entertainment no action no happy ending it will be under 5.6 imdb rating üí§üí§

So many content doesn't have hindi audio. Mostly japanese anime. You should work on it.
Netflix is consuming battery a lot after the update. Please check this
You took most of the 90s anime off why?
Mostly old movies. Data can also be a constraint as most people in 3rd world countries buy data subscription in megabytes
"Buggy. Not only do subtitles frequently show only a fraction of a second, but you still refuse to provide english subtitles of only the foreign language portions. Awful list interaction if it's longer than 10 or so, where it's always refreshing/reloading forcing you to the top again."
Its been good so far but im unable to use it on my tablet samsung galaxy s6lite i keep getting an erro message
Don't know
Good but are you trying to remove every good movie/series
It is not working in Pakistan.. When i want to purchase a subscription . The app says we have sent a code to your mobile a one time otp but i will not receive any otp.
Th apps is very good and we don't see any disguting advertise but unfortunately we don't found good movie too
"Please upload more of Japanese anime üòä thanks.... Wow., I just updated my Netflix and I couldn't log in to watch any movie, it's telling me my device isn't part of the household,... I don't like this update please fix it, thanks."
No harry potter no crimes of grindalwald fast and furious series leaving soon

"I think the app needs an upgrade to it's app design. It needs to add full list of it's library and an option to choose what country the movies and show from not just limited to where the subscribers from, English shows, and Korean. As a person who likes to watch foreign language shows having this option is very convenient to chose what to watch"

Why I cannot download any video in netflix
The content is losing it's charm and it's not enganging any more. Also please enable 2FA authentication.
Fine app but the recommendations aren't great and no option to turn off games so half the time in the app is spent ignoring ads for nonsense I won't use
DC retry EU reef

I hope that you can syncronize the brightness of Netflix with the phone brightness. The brightness of Netflix is too much. Please solve this.
Have good shows and movies to watch. But screen is to dark. Turning your brightness up on your phone or on the show You're watching in general won't do it anything.
I just star uset
App will not download onto new phone!
"Netflix is good, but I observed that there are very few movies added to the app for viewing. If search for a movie it don't display because it is not added to Netflix... Why?"
recharge nahi ho raha hai
Everything ok
Not all movies available for all countries... Subtitles and dub are not available mostly. Otherwise it's the best. I'll admit it's the reason I open my mobile
but the problem is that it is again and again telling to give money to upgrade but I already have chosen the package of 1 tv and two mobile and after all of it I have payed for upgrade of 1 more mobile but again that stupidstuff comes like upgrade or stop one if this don't come it is loading for infinity . if nobody is watching . If I am only watching on my mobile. it is again coming. upgrade I don't know the problem but I am sick of it. it is going for two and more days it is very bad .
Is ok too much money for people on ssdi
"The app is ok but there are some season that are not there to complete the movie like the flash, Supergirl etc so pls kindly do something about it for me to finish the movies."
It glitches (sometimes) on my phone but not on my tv. So annoying! Please do something
Every show I want to watch has taken off Netflix for no reason.
Where has the netflix widget gone? It was really useful. Please bring it back showing new releases and continue watching list.
Since joining Netflix I keep on getting scam emails and scam phone calls from Netflix.
Great
"I have a problem. When I wanted to open the apps, it said to choose like a gmail acc using the smartlock thingy so press the gmail. But then it brings me back to home for no reason. I tried it multiple times and its still the same. Email me if you dont understand."
better than TV
"Dear netflix, why nowadays we can't watch anything while on call? It's such a disheartening...wish you would bring back where I was able to watch netflix movies while in call too....thank you..."

It is to hard to get in Netflix I made a new account but it did not let me use the account I don't even know what's going on but it's still a good app .
"I cycle between watching on the phone and on Chromecast. The continuation from where I left of, or when moving to the next episode completely malfunctions. I'm surprised no one has fixed this till now."
Hate paying for what I can't get on my phone
"I travel a lot, and i keep having to temporarily sign in on different wifi codes because I'm not on my ""home network"". Really cheap move that other streaming services haven't taken"

First time my experience si
Why the new Mecool km6 tvbox is not Netflix certified. I am a paying customer and I cannot change the font size or the backround color of the subtitles neather the default subs language. Very annoying.
"Volume on television or you tube is different in NETFLIX, NETFLIX sounds/Volume is very low....Volume on television i only put on 20 and that's already loud enough for me, but if i go to NETFLIX i need to put it on 50??? so i can hear it....the sounds effect is okay but the voices of the characters it's very low, and when you higher the volume the sound effect is higher too then you need to hold the remote/controler to make it low the sounds again üôÑüôÑ"
Too hard to establish
good app
The app itself is very user friendly and it used to be almost flawless but if you skip forward or backwards it gets stuck with the circular progress indicator just going round and round until you have to go back to the homepage and reopen the video where it instantly plays again. Pretty annoying...
The app is good
Add some more good animes
"The app is bugged. I'm on episode 12 but when the next episode starts, the subtitles aren't working so I exit and it takes me way back to episode 8 at the start when I've already finished it and a few others eps"
Why I can't process my payment?whats wrong?
"Does anyone else have this weird bug where if you change the brightness in the app, you are never able to change it to be very dim again?"
"Some good movies and Asian series, but overall not that satisfied."
The app has been continuing to crash on my mobile device and giving different errors such as saying that it can't reach the server.
"Hi Developer, this App doesn't get saved on my home screen after the download. Can you help sort this."
Many movies i searched but couldn't find any.....new movies are coming very late
"I was enjoying this app,until last few months ago my device is no longer on netflix account,I couldn't watch anything."
Meh
"Signing in is difficult but the aap is good, niceeeeeeeeee"
Not freeüò°
Nice app if I knew how to make a Netflix series it would be better overall a solid app tho. It does lack the experience of anyone being able to make a show. Overall Great app for watching shows no adds or sponsors and there are categories overall solid app.
Overall nice experience !! Can be improve by including more English (universal language) dubbed series & anime which will be more beneficial rather than including so many other languages which make no sense üòî
"Love your app, hate your anti-family values wokeness"
I like Netflix but the household thing is messed up I logged into my grandma's account and guess what I'm not apart of the household and I don't get it when my GRANDMA LET ME USE HER ACCOUNT
"Love Netflix, love this app. Very easy to use, compatiple with my device. Works smoothly. Very happy with this app. UPDATE 5/22/24 screen completely blacked out on 1of my devices and the Netflix brightness does not work, why? Am I being limited on which device I can watch Netflix on? Down rated to three stars because it works,but not on my revvl phone 4+ anymore, it did at one time & about a month ago it stopped. I can hear audio, but not see or adjust screen brightness. I see options -no video"
"Can't open it on my tablet, deleted the app installed it again same issue giving error !!"
"I like netflix as it has many shows that i absolutely love but i hate that they cancelled Anne with an e, like why! It's my favorite TV show ever, I've not seen a series more amazing than this . I am really really disappointed, i just want a continuation of the story, it's been left off at such a horrible cliff hanger, we need to know what happens between Gilbert and Anne, Annes college life, the Indians! Does Kakwed go back to her parents? So much more that i want to know. Please bring it back."
No new movies
Subtitles not playing in auto next mode
Video player is now off-center
Great app to watch movies but whenever i find a movie interesting on Youtube i always want to watch it and the only way for me to watch is in Netflix and when i search them up and i get disappointed because the movie isnt on Netflix.

I like the app but there's a bug tha is changing the language of my Netflix to Chinese and it's very irritating

It happened a while ago while I tried to watch then it became a blackscreen then I can't even press any button on my phone. It is powered off by this app. üòî I tried it again and then it happens again. So i uninstalled it already.
They should give the option to set your desired video settings it sucks sometimes even if you r using high speed internet but netox thinks it is not which then create this confusion and kill the mood
I love this app so much For the fact that it keeps me busy and it shows whatever u want
It's really good but Netflix doesn't have spy x family code white on Netflix
User interface not good
I can't watch movies while I'm on a call. Is there a way to change the settings or this is just how it is?

It is lagging and I don't know why. Please help

"Update: The reason I uninstalled Netflix is because around 2 years ago, it was because they kept on raising up the prices. It was $19.99 2 years ago, and now it's $22.99. If they had live TV with a DVR, I would have jumped right on it right away. I'm surprised they haven't yet. There's a lot of money with live TV, including movies. Something like YouTube TV streaming, and it comes with a DVR in the app. Pick any TV and movies of your liking. Come on, Netflix, get with the program, wake up!"
"Was great at First. Now I have an issue with the brightness. Netflix over rides my brightness and turns it all the way up, even with the slider turned all the way down on both app settings and my phone settings. Please fix this!!!"
"The resolution always changes from L1 to SD, even I uninstalled many times, Pls fix this issue."
This is very nice app for freedom
"On the Pixel 8, brightness is on absolute blast all of the time, so it's impossible to use this app I'm dark surroundings, such as in bed."

I love watching movies and there's some great movies and shows on here
"If you prefer to watch some content in other language you find the whole inf in your language of preference, but audio is only in English. I think if you can't offer the whole set in a specific language don't promote it in others languages. Let the people know is only in one language. Period"

Strobe effect is troublesome. Else the experience was good.
"I'm not the person that does reviews on apps, but Netflix is okay. I really don't use it that much to watch a show or a film. Rather, I would use it when I feel like it."
The option to rate and add to list by either tap-and-hold or buttons under the movie itself would be great. It's a hassle having to click on the movie before i can add it to list

lucky the tv version is good
Nice
Not up to my expectations
Horrible
Widget stopped working on my tablet. It has disappeared and I have all updates installed
Best app for me
", v"
Some drama episode the subtitle didnt working.. we paying this bad service
"It's an exceptional app. Allows to download and watch movies, series etc offline. The only issue I have is that there is mostly older movies and it takes a awhile for newer later movies to come onto the app."
"Well, it hasn't been used in the phone app for a while now it sits on the logo only no matter if I re-download twice and refreshed it more , Hlo Netflix I hope this gets fixed or you tell us a solution"
"Search box results in ""can't connect to Netfix"". I have update, deleted and re-installed. Nothing helps. Please fix."
All New movies not add here that is bad
Take the games off. Do something else with them. I don't want them to be the first thing I see every time I log in. And where is my continue watching list? I have to search what I was watching every single time! It's been like this for months now. Please fix.
Normal
"Me gusta netflix hay muchas pel√≠culas que me encantaron, pero la verdad estoy cambiando de opini√≥n porque ya estuvo borrando las mejores pel√≠culas y series, como las sirenas mako que se va pronto y borraron muchas pel√≠culas que eran muy buenas pero ya no me esta gustando mucho, espero que me lean porque ya no estoy viendo mucho netflix con las pel√≠culas y series que hab√≠an borrado üòûSirenas Mako era mi serie favorita... Mi infancia :("
I just wanna say sooo amazing app
Old version is much better than this version try to improve kindly
The search bar doesn't work anymore. How are we supposed to search for movies and sitcoms.
"I've had Netflix for several years, and was very disappointed when they cut the DVD part of it. Not long ago the app was changed, so now when a movie finishes playing, instead of my phone going to sleep it just starts playing trailers for other shows. I use my phone to watch movies as I'm going to sleep, so this change is HIGHLY irritating because the trailers wake me up again. I keep hoping new updates will put it back to how it was."
Come on Netflix and update every five days? Seriously?
I tried to uninstall Netflix from my phone because I do not use it on my phone. Why can I not uninstall the Netflix app I need to clear it off so I can have more room for something else I have Netflix on my tablet and I have it on my fire stick I don't need it on my phone very disappointing
As good shows

"This would be a 5 stars, because the app itself works flawlessly for me, however, it lacks a feature that I consider paramount (pun intended): the possibility to turn off the screen and keep simply listening to your favorite show. It is something that people would use regularly while traveling or before sleeping, when the situation requires your eyes focusing on something else, or simply for a more light entertainment. Strongly hope devs keep notice of this missing functionality."
"I have nothing but problems connecting my devices to Netflix. Netflix is very restrictive. Use to have 'second home', not anymore. Funny thing is I could have over a hundred people logged onto my account with all their devices, 2-5 devices each. Yet I'm having trouble with 4 devices. What senses up make? Netflix does have a good selection, but I'm considering just using the free apps to watch what I want and cheaper."
"Yeah it's fine, lots of content but a ridiculous price range, what on earth made you people force consumers to pay $23 for an extra two profiles when it was included before? I though the idea was to have one option for ads and one option without ads. KEEP THE DESIGN SIMPLE AND AFFORDABLE CHRIST. Our wages haven't gone up that much, I bet yours have though."
This app is getting worse by the week. Constantly have to log out and log back in to reset. It freezes up and buffers all the time. I have the most expensive wifi because we work from home. I don't understand it this service was never like this whats up? Do better!! But no problem raising the monthly fee. We watch other streaming services more because we don't want to mess with Netflix üòï
"I don't know who's idea it was to have games on the main page when I open my netflix app but I must say it was a TERRIBLE idea. I understand if its on my kids' profiles but not mine, I dont use netflix for games, especially not 'sponge bob get to cooking', I use it to watch my dramas. So no, I will not play sonic mania nomatter how big you make the ad. Atleast make the setting to see games on the main page optional because it is super irritating."
"I had no issues with app prior to the ads. Now when I download any movies to watch for later, they disappear at the beginning of the following month i.e., I downloaded 3 or 4 in March, only watched. As of today, the other 3 movies are gone. This happened in February as well so I thought it was just me but now I'm certain it's not. Please fix. Ty"
"I have mixed feelings about this app. Yes, you get to watch shows/movies/etc for free without any ads, but they always take off the best shows and movies,and then add the worst things that look insufferable to watch. Also cancelling shows that everyone has been waiting for (specifically talking about ""I am not okay with this."") I kinda just wanted to complain lmao but good app I guess"
"When the EFF are you going to fix the brightness issues with Android?!? Multiple phones, multiple Android updates, multiple years! If you adjust or even accidentally touch the brightness control in the Netflix app, it breaks the brightness control. Your phone's brightness is overridden, the Netflix brightness doesn't work properly, and you literally need to clear the storage (not just cache) on the app to fix it. That's essentially uninstalling and reinstalling. How has this not been fixed yet!?"
"There are several end user issues that need to be cleaned up on this app. The hot and new selection has a bug. It says ""Failed to Load, try again."" I tried loading 12 times and I uninstalled the app and reinstalled the app. Still a problem. The other annoying thing is that it is not clear how to find episodes and seasons from the app."
Ever since newest updates won't cast to my t.v I've updates un-installed and reinstalled the app on all my devices and it won't let me cast through Chromecast. This is so stupid. If I can't cast it then I'm just going to cancel it. The whole point of the app was that I could just cast it and watch it anywhere without needing to buy something Device to plug into a t.v that's not a smart t.v with apps. It won't even let me cast it to my projector anymore. I'm so over it Netflix.
"I don't often review apps, but I LOVE the audio-only feature!! Amazing. A great option for people who can't or don't like to watch and prefer to listen. Edit: this feature is gone and also Netflix can't seem to keep up with my Pixel 8 Pro; the image is very choppy."
"Used to be a great streaming app with lots of amazing movies and TV shows, now most of them aren't even that good and with this 'no sharing password' policy the app crashes and doesn't let you watch stuff when at home, connected to the same WiFi you set up my account."
"I already changed my password a number of times but the amount of unauthorized login never change, they keep on signing in to my account.l, different places, different devices. I followed the password requirements but it seems your security can't keep up with these hackers. Please add an OTP function when signing in to new devices."
"Actually Netflix is ‚Äã‚Äãbetter but it has one drawback, it cannot adjust the video quality, the video is played in high quality due to which data gets consumed very quickly, it should have options like 1080p (HD) 720p (HD) 480p(sd) 360p(sd) 240p(sd) 144p(sd)."
"Updated review. Love the app, but now subtitles are not always at the bottom. They switch from top to bottom, so I struggle to focus on any of the movie visuals because I have to find the subtitles every few minutes"
"I have been facing some streaming issue lately. Sometimes the video doesn't work, and it's just the audio that keeps on going, which is annoying when it happens multiple times while you are trying to watch a movie. Please looking into it Netflix."
"It works, but it did corrupt my SD card when saving some movies for offline viewing so I'll never use that feature again. Also, despite never being opened and background use not allowed, it turns itself on every phone restart..."
"Been 2months, when im trying to search for games or shows it will have this message on screen "" Can't connect to Netflix."" It has been a on and off issue till now. Switchin to wifi or data still the same."
"I like Netflix a lot but one thing I don't like is the fact that every time I like a show or movie it gets taken off or cancelled. Like Julie with the Phantoms I'm a teen who loves that show and got really excited about a second season only for it to get cancelled it happened also with Anne with a E. So if you want a good TV source it's a good one but don't get to attached to the shows you watch because they might not get a second season if it ""doesn't reach it's intend audience""."
"@Netflix,the app has been a good app before I cancelled my subscription. But after renewing my subscription, am unable to play anything on it, it's always showing an error message . Please help correct this glitch"
I am using Netflix since 2 years . But I have cancelled autopayment last month and again tried to take membership of 149/- for mobile . Payment have been cut from my account once but again after opening the app it said YOUR PAYMENT IS PENDING . I thought I have done some sort of mistake and again paid 149/- but again it is saying the same . Some are saying RUPAY card is not accepted by netflix but I have used UPI even though it is saying the same damn thing
"While watching movies and no ads on a good deal is great casting downloaded or while streaming shows/movies in a larger screen is such a hustle I get everything except the video I drop my phone a lot and my screen is always chipped or cracked so I'd rather watch from my PC when at home, so if Netflix could please fix this I don't even get the cast icon on the app!"
"This app is so good for watching movie but there some bug that you can,t see the subtitile is so anoyying you need to fix it neflixt the bug if you close the app and put the app back but it still have the bug you restart your phone but it still have i hope you Will fix the bug."
"For streaming to chromecast it works better than the SmartTV built in apps, if you can ignore the plague of mobile games that are constantly being pushed. Changing the volume for casting unmutes the sample videos. Once connected to casting, the app shouldn't unmute unless I explicitly hit the unmute icon. For English parts the English captioning is fine but once another language is spoken will often say ""speaks other language"" instead of the translation even for clearly critical scenes."
"To Users: If you are experiencing the Temporary Sign Out screen for whatever reason, try this: -Soon as the Temporary Pops up Exit out the app immediately & clear it from recents. - Go back in - it should load all profiles - Click Kids, scroll for a good 30Secs to a Min - click my netflix (or last toggle between home, search, news&hot, profile) - switch account to preferred. It should work like a charm... Hope this helps."
Didn't expect to enjoy the games but I like the selection so far. Good content selection and Originals but a far cry from what is available in the states. Which doesn't justify the cost in India especially after removing the password sharing feature. 5 stars when you make the pricing strategy more consumer friendly.
"The app is great, like no issues thus far. Streaming is really smooth. I just give it 3 stars purely for the content. Some shows are missing seasons (usually the beginning seasons) and overall weird mix of shows to pick from. Keeping our subscription for now just to watch like 2 shows..."
"Keeps switching to SD quality despite having a 200mbps internet, high res phone and ultra hd plan. Have to reinstall the app every now and then. Netflix not doing anything to address the issue"
"I cannot sign in. It keeps saying network connectivity is bad and/or check if date and time settings are correct, it'd also give me a error code or something that is: (-425), (-426), or (-427). I try to do it at home where there's strong wifi and of course the date and time settings are accurate so I don't know what's wrong."
"Why I'm I finding it difficult to sign in to my account? I keep on being told that the password is wrong yet I'm very sure it's correct. Then again if I try to change the password, I get a pop up notification that something went wrong and to try later. It's so frustrating. This has been the case for months now and I wonder if Netflix has a real help centre."
That's good but not sure why when I open the app and scroll through stuff and go to details on a show it mutes/pauses any audio I'm playing on my phone while I'm searching. I'm not trying to watch a show or play it or anything Just look at the details and it pauses my audio just for looking at the details of a show very annoying. I've stopped looking for something to watch because of this quite a few times.
I like your shows and the shows you have available along with the movies... but paying over 20 dollars for premium and having bugs is unacceptable... if it was minor bugs like some buffering sure but a bug where I have to find where I was at in a show is far annoying specially when I watch Netflix before work
"I really enjoy watching cartoons from my childhood, and this app has many of them. There is a bug that continues the movie or show you are watching when you put your phone in sleep if you don't close it or the app. I really want that to be fixed because I usually find my movie or show finished while my phone was in sleep. I then have to find the episode or spot I was at to continue from where I left off."
Man I just wish they could add a series in full for once. It feels like every time they get you hooked on a show and then you can't even finish it like I don't even trust watching shows on there anymore. The only shows they seem to be interested in posting in full are the ones that they make and I get it from a money making stance but I shouldn't have to buy another service just to complete a series
I am having a problem with adjusting screen brightness using the bar on the full screen mode. It is brighter than device's automatic one. I keep touching the bar accident ly. It would be great if you just let me use the default one. I would appreciate if you consider fixing it.
"Would have been 5 stars if we were able to organize our saved movies into folders, folders of our own making. The saved movies list is a useless place to be, how long will one scroll. With foldets, you know you'll be able to find exactly what you're looking for in seconds. This should be basic."
"Don't be fooled by very big variety of content available in the app. Most of the movies are just too boring or has too much inclusivity. Most of the time the movie has no audio in your language at all (why do you suggest it to me then?). The app has only few good titles, other content is just made to make an illusion of rich selection, but you will find yourself scrolling over and over the same titles. The app on TV has no speed control (absurd!) while apps on Android do have it."
"All things are good and fine but I would like to give some suggestion why don't you add payment method of Google Play Balance as the app is registered with Google. Many reputed streaming apps give this option such as Jio cinema and many more... That is why I am giving a 3-star rating, would definitely be 5-star if you look into this matter.. Thanks!!"
"Hindi is among the top 5 most talked language in the world ,still Netflix doesn't have many of the important tv shows and movies not dubbed in Hindi though they are dubbed in most other languages, this feels injustice, most of the viewing content on the Netflix is Western there are no old Hindi movies on Netflix I request to Netflix to focus on non-English content as well."
"The search option doesn't work in this app on my phone or on my tablet. It just says, ""Can't connect to Netflix."" Retry button makes no difference."
"No complaint about the content obviously but the app keeps showing weird stuff in the 'continue watching' section, whereas I'm sure no one else I share my password with is watching those from my profile coz my profile is locked, plus I've also reset my password recently... The display langauge also keeps changing repeatedly"
"It's is a great app but it might just be my phone because every time I start watching a movie/TV show it puts me on the lowest setting they have got on brightness and it won't let you change the setting(Netflix,please help this problem)üòÖüòÅ"
"Please enable app to a movie's title page when a movie selected from an external page. For example if I Google a movie and it says I can watch it on Netflix, when I click it to TRY and add it to my queue and read the summary, it ONLY plays the movie... No option to do anything I mentioned. And when I click the back arrow in Netflix I get kicked out back to Google. Please fix this..."
Netflix can you make a 4 digit combo to where the kids don't delete my profile anymore this happens way to often. I'm getting to the point to where I don't want to watch Netflix anymore. By that I don't see why I have Netflix. Edit that 4 digit code is for settings and deleting a user add a user no problem just access settings and deleting a user
I can't play picture in picture. Even when I uninstall the app and reinstall it and make sure it specifically allows picture in picture in the settings on my phone and on the app it still won't do it. That besides all the other screwy things Netflix is done with it's a subscription service lately I just rather go watch YouTube.
"Netflix original was excellent but now after the update, i have freezing issues and restart my phone, often! I was watching *captivating the king* and was at episode 10 (after all the waiting 1? 2? weeks between episodes, such a pain) it's a really good show, then boom, gone??? No heads up as Netflix promises? Im miffed cause, their advertisements claim this show can be watched on their app? Try as I may to find it, it's gone? Annoying..am I doing something wrong?"
"When the app works, it's great. But Netflix put our ""household"" in the wrong place and because we don't have a smart TV we cannot change it. Helpdesk couldn't even fix it. Now they're hoping their technical team can fix it soon and if it's not, we have to call back in 2 weeks. I suppose we'll have to buy a whole new TV just so we're able to fix this problem."
"They have now made it so you can't have devices that aren't frequently connected to your home Internet use your netflix, essentially turning it to a cable tv connection worth 15$. This has consistently been turning into a worse and worse deal. I can't share my netflix with my parents anymore because I'm studying away from home and can't bother to get my mother to check her email every time I want to ""termorarily"" access netflix. What a bother. Ahoy ahoy..."
"For the longest time, I was able to watch Netflix without any issues even when I was on call in between the movies on my Android phone. But these days, Netflix just freezes when on call. Is it only me or everyone is facing the same issue? Please fix this!!!"
3 stars because i can't watch after i pay the second month. And still needs to update repayment information. Haysss. It sucks. And asking another debit card. Even if they already deducted 249 pesos on my Debit Card for 2nd payment. üò° Still can't watch movies. üò°
One of the best features about Netflix was it allows the users to watch shows/movies while on voice calls but after the update that feature is gone. It will be an absolute pleasure if Netflix bring back that feature. I really hope they will fix it.
"App was updated 2 days ago, straight away the app widget disappeared, no option to add widget or icon to home screen. So annoying to have to access app via settings or play store. Couldn't uninstall and reinstall, as the last update made it an Android system app! Had no problems with the app after update on my Android mobile, but on my tablet I get this annoying issue. Hoping for another update with a fix to the issue."
I really like this app and I have no problem watching on other devices but until recently I just got a phone problem and got an old 2019 y9 Huawei phone to watch it on and to my disappointment it doesn't show any video just audio and a black screen with the subtitles. What can I do to change it? Cos I really enjoy this app.
"You're a content leader, 3 starts for that. App performance is not up to mark. For e.g. just now Netflix app went non responsive, the error message was ""Netflix is not optimised for latest version of Android touch response may be delayed or ignored."" Please make app more responsive and cool."
"Everytime I open the Netflix app on my phone, it keeps on showing this ""Your device isn't part of the Netflix Household for this account."" I have been logged in my phone and tablet for a very long time and I don't use them simultaneously. When I logged out of my tablet, this message still keeps on popping on my phone. Am I the only one having this issue?"
Extreme lack of animation.most movies and movies are mid.disney plus and hbo max got way better content. Most of netflix originals are just made to take up space throwing anything hoping something sticks. Netflix is the result of quantity over quality.pls dont waste your money and time with netflix.
I already subsribed netflix but un able to watch it on tv. It keep ask me to sign in. One time was suscced to log in but only on the phone. Not on tv. It keep ask me to finish sign up. And choose for billing. But unfortunately it says unable to proceed for billing. Iam very disappointed and i am unable to stop my account
"I mean, it does what it should do but some things should be ironed out... its kind of illogical how often the app forgets or ignores where you are in a series or movie, the in video brightness thing never really goes all the way down. Just small confusing things."
"Update from 19/3/24 has kicked me off being able to watch on my mobile, which i use every day, and even though i watched on there last night. Says my device is not part of the household network for this account. Yet the laptop is still connected to the SAME wifi. Now gotta jump through all sorts of hoops via a smart tv to get my cellphone connected!! Or buy a separate plan!? Not impressed at all, Netfix."
"Messy app with many issues. I'm travelling and suddenly, I can't download shows because app says Proxy or Unblocker detected. Then, after few attempts downloads but in wrong order. This is silly (why download episode 4 if you are not done with previous episodes). Hectic app."
Good but some stuff it just to dark to watch and yes brightness is all the way up. Prime example is the difference between watching 1st series of drive to survive compared to the others. Nice and bright compared to the silly HDR effect stuff
"I like Netflix less & less. They keep ending shows that the people want to see!! You shut production down for shows we like! WHY WHY? You want to keep making money? Then finish the shows you make. GIVE US A GREAT ENDING! Not leave us hanging. Lots of your series don't have an ending, you just stop making them.That is dumb! Wake up & give us what we like, not what you want."
"Fix the bug of subtitles! There have been months with this problem: Subs are shown incorrectly if we choose any effect like Drop shadow, Raised, Depressed, etc. There is only a big black rectangle instead of the chosen effect!"
Great with headphones but horrible with the tv. The volume just fluctuated 13 notches. It completely stopped making noise until I brought it up to 14. Then it blares loud out of nowhere. Needing to hold the remote while watching gets old fast.
Please allow the audio to continue playing in background even if the device has been put to sleep mode with screen off. Good-Great app with alot of media content still needs more content for each topic of documentarys.
"While I like a lot of the content, the inability of the player to remember where I was in an episode, jump back to the start of the episode when I press resume, or play a previous episode when that's not the one I clicked, or lose where I was when switching apps is absolutely maddening."
"Been using Netflix for years. I recently move and it has decided that I can. I longed aces because It's not the home wifi. So I the actual owner of the account that pays for it, can't even access my own account, I had to get a 30 day pass to access my own account. That's crazy."
Everything is good because I'm using a very fast wifi. But the only thing that I don't like to Netflix is they removing the movies and sometimes my favorite movie is not showing up. I still don't know who is better (Prime Video) or (Netflix)
This is the second app(both have been updated) I've had to restart my phone just to stop watching or even pause a show. Same happens with YouTube and that's just ridiculous. It's a simple task.
There is a large black bar along the top of my screen when I play anything. It doesn't save my shows either. Update: the bar got bigger and is now taking up a little less that half of the screen and now I can't download anything
"something is wrong. app worked perfectly a few days ago, tried reinstalling. whenever i tap on movies/shows after searching for them it'll flash on screen for a second and then disappear."
"The only thing I hate about Netflix is that whenever I watched a new anime they're 3rd, 4th, 5th and other season gets removed, like, take one piece as an example! Netflix was the first to introduce me to one piece and out of nowhere the ten season's of one piece is missing and later they showed egghead, like bro that's the 21th season of one piece!"
so far I have returned to this app after a breaf hiatus. I left due to the raising prices that they couldn't justify. some of the new material is binge worthy and drew me back (temporarily) but so far the newer shows' dialog is rather clunky and the acting is meh. you need to find someone that is passionate about writing and not in it for the paycheck. some of this is quite cringe worthy. just saying. I'm not sure the direction you wish to take this company but you are going at it all wrong...
"Preview isn't working. When you press on a movie or a show there's no video, only audio, unless you scroll down and up, then the video can be seen."
"Netflix lacks movies about military modern warships and modern aircraft. Battleship is the only best modern warship movie that i can find, and there's also a documentary about warships called Sea Power. The best modern military aircraft is Top gun: Maverick featuring aircrafts like F-14 Tomcat, Su-57 Felon, and other aircraft that i can't identify. Wow, they only love dramas that serve zero purpose >:(."
"For the past 10 odd years of using Netflix, I've really liked the movies and shows it has released since then. However, the recent update on my phone allows me to tap and pause the screen as usual, but when I try to tap the pause screen again to make it disappear, it only makes the brightness bar disappear instead. I am really of not in favor of this and would really like it if this was changed soon."
"The app is crashed sometimes. I have to log in and download everything all over again. What a frustrated üò†. My device is L1 , but after crashing, it's L3, so I can't watch movies in HD."
Picture keeps freezing! App has been working fine. Now the picture keeps freezing but the sound is still playing. Tried clearing cache. No fix.
Many films are missing Netflix should be wired because many people using and requires subscription... I watched Nicely to watch and very economic for data usage... But no Senegalese series dream.
What's going on !Why can't I cast my Netflix from my phone to my Chromecast anymore due to me not leaving a smart tv? It was working before all this change occurred.
"I don't know how Netflix app is resting vedios play. For instance I have watched a movie upto time 25:30 minutes, it's back to 20:40 time itself where I start watching the episode. I am using Sumsung Ultra S24 device."
Android app min brightness in the app is MUCH higher than phones native min brightness setting. Watching shows in dim lighting blinds me like staring into a thousand suns. Turning on Extra dim mode in Android settings helps but is still not enough. Please fix.
"A good app but the dubbed shows are so horrible it's like the actors are just reading from a script, no emotion, fake sounding. Any more I just give these dubbed shows a thumbs down and don't bother."
"I would give this five stars but Due to the fact that there is currently a glitch where it won't allow me to watch certain shows in my region, i cannot keep this at a 5 star rating, apparently it says i am 'using a vpn' and it keeps showing a weird proxy notice, netflix please fix this, this wasn't an issue before but now it is, I am not using a vpn nor do i own any, this is currently a glitch for my country The Bahamas (Abaco), maybe in other countries too, please fix this problem, thank you."
"App is fine and works as expected. It would be nice to have a sleep timer in the app that can be set based on time or episodes. When watching on TV, there was a ""are you still there?"" And would turn off if you didn't click anything for a couple of episodes."
"Everything works fine, but whenever I watch things on my phone I find that it sometimes turns my screen green? It's not even just in the app, I have to completely restart my phone in order to see any color besides green."
I love using Netflix and use it all the time on my phone but for some reason when I click on the programme I want to watch it goes to full screen and is black with the loading ring then it flicks back to the previous page where I'd chosen it from... I've tested my network connection and there's no problem with that other apps work streaming.... What's wrong with it what can I do to use it again i can't watch anything
"Warning - As of today, 01/31/2024, I get this from Netflix support: ""Using a mobile device to watch Netflix on a TV isn't available on an ad-supported plan. To use your mobile device to watch Netflix on your TV, you'll need to change to an ad-free plan."" Unilaterally changed the plan that I get with T-Mobile and added this little caveat to make things worse. I can no longer use my tablet to cast to my TV through Chromecast. Make sure to get Chromecast with Google TV (remote) to enable casting."
"Its a great movie/TV app. Lots to choose from, but once you watch a certain kind of show they automatically take away all of you other choice of movie content and tv content if it doesn't revolves around the kind of content that u watched once. Its irritating that all of your choice get taken away and that u have to go find it again if u want to see other things."
"Its not loading on my mobile, its just showing me the loading screen and i can't logout or login from my account whats the issue can anyone please help me I restart my phone, clear the app data and cache, uninstall the app and install it but still I'm facing the same issue"
"I can't change the aspect ratio that sometimes not right. For example it's automatically wide, but not fullscreen. Avatar: The Last Airbender is 21:9, but it's 32:9, and I can't change it."
"I love Netflix, but I have one huge problem. I signed up for Lingopie, but cancelled it. Now I cannot get rid of the Lingopie in the Netflix website. I have asked for help a few times, but I am not getting a response. Can you please help me."
"This update drags on my techno infinity zero. My phone uses an 11GB internal memory and 256GB storage size. Everytime I try seeing a movie, it drags. I have restarted my phone, cleared cache and even reinstalled Netflix but it still happens. This issue started a week ago after I updated to the latest version as at this moment. If this is fixed, I will give it a 5 star"
"I don't really see people talking about this but the new update where if your not in the Netflix household of the creator of the account then you have the options to either watch temporarily, sign out, or make a new account entirely and I don't like it since I moved out. Love the shows and movies but that's the only problem I have."
"Netflix is good but I notice I'm using it increasingly less and less. There is no IMDB integration, which I've always found frustrating, and probably because IMDB has been absorbed into the amazon universe. The search function is frustrating e.g. when I search under comedy I'm offered lots of films and programmes to trawl through that are definitely NOT comedy! And I can level this criticism accross all genre in search. I end up exasperated trying to get programmes that I want to watch!"
"Netflix shows video freezes but sounds keep on going. Been doing this for a while and yes. Closed netflix et rebooted my ps4 and my internet. And the same issue happens kver and over again. Also, please, if you are going to acquire movies that are trilogies, dont put the 2nd and the 3rd if you're not goinf to put the first movie. For the amount we're paying monthly, please fix this."
Subtitles are not able to adjust to bigger size. Although variety of movies and series are definitely better than the past.
There seems to be a glitch where the app asks to enter the pin after every episode amd the substitles dissapear. It's been more than a year since I've had this problem.
WhatsApp call on Samsung Devices stop playback on Netflix. You can't stream any video. It will show permanently pause and we can't unpause it. Should fix the bug.
"It's kinda good. Has some good movies and shows but...... when watching a movie. And someone doesn't speak English, you would think subtitles would be added to see what they are saying but nooooooo. Try watching freelance. The speak Spanish half the time and we'll no clue what they are saying"
"Ridiculous how many times I need to press the buttons to exit the app on the Roku. Making it more difficult to get out of is not going to make me watch it more, but less because I don't want the aggravation of trying to exit out of the app in Roku. Home button means exited and at the main page. Next up is cancellation altogether."
Netflix with commercials DOES NOT WORK ON MY AMAZON FIRE STICK.. IT SAYS TO RE DOWN LOAD APP.. I did and it still won't work.. I'm not gonna pay for it twice so I guess I won't watch Netflix in.my bedroom.
Netflix has recently updated its app and it is infuriating. It now opens on the coming up screen which quite frankly I don't care about. If I want to be on that screen I would direct myself there. Also the app now spontaneously plays things vertically rather than horizontally resulting in me needing to close the app and re open it quite regularly. So silly to go from a perfectly competent app to one that makes me not want to use netflix on my phone at all.
Having hard time downloading. I alwats get wi-fi connection is required for this download to continue notification even though I am connected to a wifi connection.
"The quality is good ang I got little problems since I subscribed. But I think it's best if you give the exact time release of the content so that we would not be frustrated in waiting and guessing the time of the release. I actually got pissed off today because I had been waiting for the release of a kdrama but still nothing had been upload until late night. In other countries, they already watched it and most of them spoiled it on socmed. But nobody appreciates spoiled content, right??"
It's ok. But it doesn't have all the latest streaming popular shows. It glitches sometimes. Downloads connect to phone storage and take space so it better to watch online but that affects too
Stop telling me this isn't my household account. I pay for it with the same device I'm trying to stream on. The OTP verification through a link that you receive as an SMS makes no sense at all. Everything else it great.
"Give option for the viewers to mark shows as watched. We could have watched them when they aired on tv, or from an older account, or when at someone else's place we could have watched it together on their TV. All of these are valid scenarios. We'd like to mark the shows seen in such cases."
"I've been facing many problems recently.. Subtitles are suddenly disappearing even though they Are switched on, entire episodes are missing while watching The tv show FRIENDS.. I hope you fix it soon"
"If you manage to fix the issue with it recognizing any of the devices in my household, all on the same wifi, that I've used a million times, then maybe I'll quit dropping stars."
"I very much enjoy netflix, but for some reason it will not allow me to use the app on my phone. Very frustrating.. continues to say can not connect to netflix.."
"Audios are too low, mostly all audio movies barely can hear, I have to put up my TV volume to almost full, about 80 decimal, but all the preview movies are better audio.... fix your audio system...."
What happened to Netflix? I downloaded the vids but still in the pixel picture? I watch vids but the picture freeze and the audio is still running? Even I subscribed the cheap plans (lol) doesn't mean you can give a bad service.
"Netflix is great, bt I didn't come here to rate it. I came to ask why they stopped FATE:THE WINX SAGA why!! Agh Netflix is always so disappointing they removed the best shows and stayed with the worst shows I don't understand... Why bring the show to the app anyway..? For what to leave us puzzled? Well, they're definitely doing a great job making people hate the app little by little LAST BUT NOT LEAST.. Netflix, are you doing this for the viewers, who from my knowledge PAY! or for yourselves?!"
"Normally works well but I'm catching up on one piece, if I watch some episodes on the TV, the minute I switch to phone it acts up... it's just mine too and not the other 2 on the account... aggravating"
"Poor compared to the TV version. Too rigid, you need to be able to personalise the app more. Also, why is it that nothing that I look for and find using the ""search"" option will load?"
Using it on a Samsung Tab S9 and the UI is blurry. The movies/shows itself are ok but the movie/tv show posters on the UI are very blurry. Anyway this can be fixed?
The app keeps freezing or the show will become blank and your only getting audio. I have to keeping closing it and pulling it up again.
My experience has been great so far but now whenever i open the app it tells me it cant find a connection im connected to wifi and have reinstalled the app as well as upsating before uninstall but none of that worked verry confused
Im all ways on a call and when nothing is going on I like to watch show but it will not let me I love the shows but I truly don't know if I will keep netflix if this is not changed as I was able to before updating it to the most recent update
"I'm a new user to netflix, i can't expect some unavailable features, like 1. Video quality adjustable not available 2. Speed option available on web versions but not on windows version"
The subtitles continue to dissappear and I have to clear the cache of the app for them to come back. Its to the point where I have to do this multiple times a day.
The app won't let me sign out other devices. I am the account owner and it's ridiculous that I can't control my account. The manage account and devices is completely USELESS.
"I seriously miss having a sleep timer. Would be nice, instead of the app going on forever and ending up waking me up+ having a very hard time to find again where I was in the series or movie."
Netflix is great but I think it's annoying and unfair how you can have like 5 accounts but only have 2 people watching at a time it's really annoying and also sometimes it won't save were I am on a episode or even sometimes it will take me to a whole other episode if I'm rewatching a series it's super annoying but yeah other than that it's fine
"It achieves the bare minimum by running (mostly) consistently, and, as is their base goal, allows you to view the content available to your region. However, viewing window closes on its own if the episode or movie ends (if the window is not full-screen ~ which feels like ""pick-me"" behavior tbh.) They give you the option to multi-task, but only in episode-long intervals. And I don't even know why they have a games section, especially since they download as an additional app anyway."
"On Chrome OS, you cannot have this in a small window while doing work as it takes up the whole screen which if you're trying to do work while catching up with a TV series you best be having to a dual monitor setup. Other services do have this capability of being a small window. I don't understand why Netflix hasn't enabled this."
"Netflix use to be the place to watch movies, shows etc. Netflix price point in terms of it's offerings has become expensive. I wouldn't be surprised to see future consolidation in some of these subscriton service as the pace of new subscribers allows down. Ultimately, keep prices are going to be a key drawback in these services. I will be leaving Netflix due to pricing."
"It's a great app with many movies and series and great quality. There is one problem I have with it though and that is that netflix removes some movies or series and without a reason (?) I find it very frustrating, same thing is that they publish for example part 4 of some movie and not the other parts. I think they should be more active with uploading new parts of series (especially anime) and uploading all parts of movies."
"Poor support team. If a show or movie isn't playing I the resolution it advertises on the preview they tell you to go to a desktop, and file a ticket for each episode and movie. Takes months to fix. :("
"It's a good app to watch kdrama, movies,etc but lately the subtitles when I'm watching a drama are delaying a little. The subtitles are going fast and not translating the exact word. Please fix this problem asap."
"The app keeps telling me my device isn't part of the household plan, which is weird because I haven't changed my device and it was working perfectly fine two days ago."
"When I casually pause the video for a moment and resume it, it bugs! It is annoying to resume it again"
"Obviously if people download videos, it's because they don't have access to internet so it defeats the purpose of downloads if we have to connect to switch between profiles to access our downloads."
Decent selection of movies. Adds new stuff often. The price is a little spendy but worth it if you have to watch a few times a week
I love the app the only reason it's only 3 stars is because they don't have every one piece episode. (Who thinks netflix and CrunchyRoll are working together for money because not every episode of one piece and other animes are on Netflix.)
"The only problem I have, is when you download something and it gets removed off of Netflix it also gets removed off your downloads also they keep switching from NCIS to friends on the thing which is weird"
How can I know how many times I have played a Netflix content in my account or profile ? Is there a feature to know this ? If not would you be able to implement this in the application ?
I can't even use it because when I want to focus on the payment plans it directs me to a code and I keep clicking next but nothing happens. I've used 3 different gmail accounts
"Am having problems with my downloads, can't download more series,am using one device and it keeps saying that i have too many downloads on this device or on another device, how do i fix it,how many series can i download"
Im searching for good movies but its always for kids showing up.. i want to watch action movies but its for kids always showing up even horror movies its not popping up.
I hate the household thing but free offer is nyc and I also think that they should add movie series and movies that aren't available here cause we can't afford two movies apps
Some movies aren't available in some regions! It would be nice to have this looked into.Overall its great!
They really need to improve the interface with Google home which will not allow you to select an episode or a season
The titles are too small to read. I can't zoom. I would like to see more well known actor's in high budget movies.
"""The roast of Tom Brady"" will not stream to Chromecast. I can stream the rest of the Netflix catalog to my Chromecast What's the problem with this?"
"Had this app for like 5 years. It's Kool. The only thing that sucks is that ""They don't release episodes quick enough."" I have to wait to watch my show!!! It takes so long. I tried to see if I could find other streaming services that carry the same shows. But until then ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è also I wish they would change the algorithm. I sometimes feel like watching raunchy comedies, or anime, maybe some 90's movies or early 2000's. Once you watch certain things it won't show you everything. Only specific genr"
"Everything is good i like it but theres a problem. ""The Rookie"" is one of my favorite movie. Theres 6 seasons exists but Netflix only shows 4 of them. Why? If its a bug or a problem please fix it."
"It was great before the latest update. Now, it's barely usable. They went all style and no intuitive layout, and I can't stand it. Might actually cancel my subscription after 15+ years because it takes twice as long to find anythjng and it's nearly impossible to navigate while multitasking."
Glitches! Was working great and now every 5 seconds the picture freezes for good. If I fast forward it works for 5 seconds again. So annoying
I wanted to downgrade my membership plan from premium to basic but after countlessly navigating through the app I seem to be suspicious of the entertainment platforms intentions to keep me at the highest plan in order to receive my monthly payments for old content and over 50% of foreign language viewings. I would prefer a multi diversal audio option for most movies and shows if that is the case. The good content however is one season or limited.
"SUPER annoying that it now opens to the ""new and hot"" page instead of the home page. It's the HOME page! It's where you're supposed to start! If the ""new and hot"" page had a search button, it wouldn't be as much of an issue for me, still an issue, but less. I have to change to the home page just to search for something."
"Sudden lag, audio out of sync, even when it's already downloaded. Pause and resume only fix it for seconds, and then happen again."
"Very dispointed in Netflix, lately. The same plan that I've used for years, suddenly doesn't allow me access anymore. My tv won't even play it anymore unless i spend more money. They even NOW have a feature where you can't even watch certain choices unless you pay even MORE than the extra that they're tryng to extort. If I had known, I probably would not have renewed my membership when I did."
Problem on motorola razr 40 ultra - the app doesn't flip to landscape mode! I have tried everything and turning On/Off the auto rotate function of the mobile but Netflix is the only one with a problem (every other video streaming app works correctly) when starting to stream the app actually goes into landscape mode (flips automatically) but in a microsecond returns to horizontal and stays in full screen but horizontally so you only see a part of the video. Help?
"This Netflix app on smart TVs buffers and freezes a lot while all the other apps (prime, peacock, yttv, etc) don't. No issue on Netflix app on phones or tablets, just smart TVs. Also it would be helpful to move the 'exit' button to the left side below the menu list for the smart TV layout."
Please enable password sharing again. I am a student who lives apart from family for more than just 31 days. Its not possible for me to login to home wifi. This step is a very poor choice from Netflix.
Every time I want to watch something the audio description always turns on with is really annoying cause I'll have to go on settings and turn it off then continue watching but it ruins the mood and I have tried to trun off this thing but apparently you can't with I phone but you can cause I tured it off on my old phone so unless you like cleaning when your watching I'd watch on a different platform if you get annoyed easily. But other then that it's a great app.
"Glitching badly recently and as much as not only myself pay but other customers, and have also watched prices over the years increase, I'm starting to question its reliability. Especially with rumors that the Tyson and Jake Paul fight are supposedly to be featured in July. If it can't handle its viewers now, how is it gonna handle one of the most popular fights?"
Hi currently watching Dexter and for some episodes the audio is just static. I have tried watching on other devices and it is the same. Please fix this!
"It keeps saying your device isn't part of your Netflix household but the device, my phone, is the one that set up everything in the first place. I've tried to fix it on the TV but I don't have a remote to open the app, I do everything on my phone and I can't find anything that tells how to fix it with your android phone. Very frustrating. Now I have a temporary thing but I'd rather have it work correctly."
My app crashes all the time while I'm watching a movie it didn't used to do this. I think the quality of the movies have gone down Nothing new a lot of old stuff To watch. Wish I knew more foreign languages. I have to watch a lot of your movies With enclosed caption turned on. A lot of marriage don't have it in English language.
"While l must say l enjoy Netflix, l am rather disappointed by their search engine which always says can't connect to Netflix when in fact Wi-Fi is working just fine."
"After the new update no matter what I am watching subtitles turn on and I have to manually turn them off. Its absolutely annoying. Also, not too happy my free Netflix with no ads now costs me money thanks to a change you made today during the middle of the day apparently. Would of been nice to know of a price increase beforehand"
"Can you not shove the games in front of my face everytime I open the app, I came to watch not play. The UI now is very cluttered with your ads(games) make a separate app or company for your game's. Gawd I hate the mindset of an everything app."
"Great shows. Not a fan of the multiple price increases. That being said, I'm really here to make a suggestion. Netflix can you please make it so that I can download shows in the background on my tablet? Whenever I minimize Netflix, it stops all downloads unless I'm actively on Netflix. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Tab S6."
"I find Netflix's to be great but, Netflix's choices in various shows is painfully awful. As Netflix's is culturally diverse Netflix's still lack in the area of diversity. I understand that Netflix's does enough simply to say look at our platform we are the front runners of D.E.I... I understanding what I see would like to see more diversity and better movies."
"I'm unable to view the full list of My List on my phone. Additionally, sometimes, if I exit the Netflix app halfway through a drama or movie for a minute and then enter back the Netflix app, the drama or movie that I stopped can't be played. I would have to leave the drama or movie that I was watching (go back to home page) and then choose the same drama or movie that I was watching"
Don't know if this is a bug that's happening but if I have a video playing on my phone and then I go to another app and then go back to Netflix if I didn't pause the video beforehand then when I go back it doesn't resume playing it it gets stuck on a loading screen. My troubleshooting is to go back to the main menu and then select the video where I left off of.
Disappointed that Netflix thinks it's a good idea to enable a feature that automatically downloads movies to my device without my consent (Smart Downloads). I understand the purpose of the feature but it should not be enabled by default.
"This app is AMAZING,but the only problem for me is that most of the time netflix working just fine but then after a few weeks i can't even click on what account i want it won't let me choose and,at other times it's just a black screen with the netflix logo at the to right corner,so please if you could fix it then that would be great"
"Weak starter initially- via Provider but has nurtured itself well. Shuts down, pauses or closes with little warning- believing viewer has 'had enough'‚Ä¢but strong in NEEDED features, audio strength and ALL video. Content availability has improved [a bit] after lagging behind others while news and sports remain unavailable at least at tested tier level. On screen brightness adjustability plus other NEEDED features provide a nice package althoughüëé'best' movies and docs' are limited. SDüëçPARKING!"
"I enjoy watching on my phone or TV, however here lately I've been watching on my phone an I feel it's a bug issue that needs addressed. Every time I leave the app it's not remembering where I last was watching something an it's also Not remembering to keep subtitles Off. I've cleared my cache an done an update but I feel ya'll need to fix something!! It's only on my phone I've noticed but overall I enjoy watching the app"
It skips a lot of scenes in the movie. If you can please fix that. So that a movie or series plays without skipping any scenes
"I like the Netflix but sometimes the netflix wont work anymore and its keeping say that you are using a unblocking. its allways that if i watch a movie, kam yo fix the problem pleaseüò≠"
"ADD A PERMANENT SKIP INTRO OPTION FOR SERIES as everyone who uses netflix to watch or should I say binge watch episodes, having to watch an intro each episode is so annoying, can do it if your using the website versions. but not in ANY app??? Please fix this as it's one of the worst features not having this as an option ...."
"It's a nice app, but most times, you scroll without finding anything to watch, also please more English audio subtitles are needed for Korean series, especially for physically challenged ppl like those that find it hard to see or read the subtitles."
The brightness bug is really annoying and has been going on for awhile. I watch Netflix mostly at night so turning down the brightness was very convenient. If this could be fixed then 5 star for sure
"the ui when while playing anything no longer disappears on command/tap. it floats in front of the video for a long time and is very, very distracting. updates were supposed to make the app better, not the opposite."
"Hi, why is my Netflix telling me my password is wrong? I have already reset the password once because it was telling me it was wrong, then when resetting tried the old password but it said, of course, I couldn't use an old password. Now it's doing it again. I don't want to change my password again, any solution?"
"For long time I am using this app and it is very entertaining app ,but suddenly the is not supporting to my oppo A53 mobile, please clear the bug"
Why are somr movies and sitcoms got a lock on them . If I pay for a streaming app i should be able to watch everything on that app . I mean what's the point of paying for something and then they want you to pay inside it for its services .
"I hope that they add those series that have already finished the next season, because when I want to rewatch them, I can't continue because they did not put the next season, even though it is finished and already published."
It is good but if you play it on one tv and you have a home holiday home we're you go to for 3 days a week you can not Can not watch it without changing your password. you should not have to I have to do it every time
"I am enjoying the app, but all I need is for you people to to update the app ,so you can watch your downloaded movie when your subscription has expired tha is why I am rating it 3star"
Why the brightness is too low or too high on Android phone? With normal lighting even with high brightness video is still low light and with low brightness in low light it is too birght. Is there a way to fix this.
Guys i liked this app but its saying soon you will be able to watch any movies series and it's also saying we are sending a email to ( email name) and not letting me in
"Unable to store on SD card. Perhaps a fix for users using a galaxy tablet, the app has the option but when selecting SD card as download option, it auto reverts to internal storage. I have read online many others with this issue. Netflix can you please rectify on next update. Otherwise great app."
"It isn't bad nor good. With my experience, the app works completely fine, but I do have some issues with it. The big point is the increase of pricing and the discontinuing of shows. Shows being added then being taken off. It is frustrating to have to see something one day and gone the next."
"I've been encountering recurring issues on my Samsung S23FE One UI 6.O. Despite supporting Full HD Widevine L1, I often experience a drop to L3 SD clarity. This necessitates uninstalling and reinstalling or clearing cache/data to restore Full HD. Moreover, I've been facing device errors lately, requiring frequent restarts for Netflix to function. I believe these technical glitches are hindering the overall experience. I kindly request the development team to investigate and address these issues."
"With one of the recent updates to Netflix for Android phones, it no longer remembers where I am in a show if I exit the app. It starts everything over at the beginning. Please fix this! Uodare: Now it is at least a little closer on where it restarts, but now every time I start a show it has closed captioning turned on."
The full screen ad when I open the app is hella annoying and made even more so because I can't close or minimize it.
"Please do something with brightness, it's so troublesome to watch at night as the brightness is high for Netflix if you low the brightness then also the brightness is high over all quality and content is best."
Suddenly my Netflix is not working. It's saying can't connect to Netflix. I'm connected to wifi as well
Overall the app is very good. The customer service is horrible. They really don't appreciate their customers and will not grant any compensation for technical difficulties.
Subtitles are not in sync sometimes. Except that good experience. Please resolve subtitle sync issue.
What happened to all the classic shows! I try and look for old shows. GONE! old movies. GONE! Old documentary. GONE! BRING IT ALL BACK. Or I am leaving Netflix!
"Hi Netflix Team, Why, mostly movies, tv drama series and seasons don't have Hindi dubbed language movies. I want to watch hollywood movies in hindi language but facing difficulty.But most of the Hollywood movies are in English language..."
"There aren't too many good horror movies and most importantly what is up with this new NETFLIX HOUSEHOLD THING ... me and my sister live in 2 diff cities but our mother used to pay for one acc and we used to share and now because of this , netflix wants us to have to different accounts which means 2 times the money ITS UNREASONABLE... its OUR money and OUR account within the account sharing limit we can share our ACCOUNT WITH as many people we want no matter where they live ... THIS IS NONSENSE"
I became regular subscriber because netflix can be played on calls but the recent update has made it unable to stream while on calls. Please fix this.
this app is great and alll but i travel alot and connect to al the hotels i stay at wifi and when i do my netflix does not want to work and i can not use my mobile data it is to much
"Usually good, but as of today the app stopped working for me. Other apps like Hulu are working just fine so it's not an issue with my device or internet."
It's good. But you should have a feature where you see the recent episodes first especially in long series so ni need to scroll down.
Neat UX . Option to control video quality can be given within the app like other ott platforms.Separate reels tab with highlights of the show would be good option to explore content.
"If you are going to have parental controls, then don't offer those shows in their profile, only to put up the stop when they try to play it. What a stupid design!"
Actually I think Last update was worst I mean when I search some thing on Netflix so I face problem thet is The uper line mean top line videos not play when I clicked any one of these so I exist please solve This issue
"It keeps signing us out at the end of the month for payment issues, and we can't get back in to pay for the account. We have to keep resetting it for it to work"
"Using it for nearly 7 years! Never had a problem! Just today, it started behaving strange! Won't play any movie on my phone!"
"is there a way to make subtitles setting different on each device? i use large font for tv, but it's too large when i'm on my phone and vice versa. help please"
Not good but not bad . But I can't hear any sounds from netflix while connecting Bluetooth headsets
"I pay 20 dollars a month, and they still show me apps that I should download on my phone, I Don't need apps recommendations, and I really hate that new thing new and hot, it's so annoying"
"It's better to add telugu language to movies.Only little number of movies are available in telugu dubbed.Some movies available in telugu in browser,but those movies also not available in Netflix with dub."
"dear Netflix I have a problem and that is I want to ""how to eliminate my teacher"" and it's not there in my Netflix and I searched about this then it shows that it's available in Netflix I kindly request for yours solution thank you"
"Thank you Netflix I like your app. However, I would like to ask if a feature for time out would be add. Would appreciate more if that would done."
"Widget disappeared? I use this daily. I thought I may have done something by accident, but nope, the widget just disappeared and can't be replaced. Why?"
App was not working properly. When I try to play the video screen turns into green and app is not responding to the system
"It's okay. I cannot find the widget anymore. I used to put it on my homescreen for easy access, after the last update I can't even find it"
You guys reject my card which is very frustrating üò§ Could have given it a 5 star but just want my card to be accepted overall its quite a great app. Please fix the issue and will re-edit my review Thanks
Why does it out of no where stop playing hdr videos in Samsung s22 ultra. And why is the max quality full HD when resolution of the phone is 1440p. Please make the app more stable
I dont know if its just my phone or something but when i watch movies the voice is delayed making it not fun no more...fix the bug please.
I was happy to watch Netflix but suddenly my device is not supporting Netflix ... don't know how to fix this problem...I have only one phone
"This may sound trivial, but with the latest update you removed the widget. It's a fixture among my home screens & it's gne."
Great viewing but may you please install a language sensor on your apps across all platforms. The language is very bad in a lot of your content.
Recently I haven't been able to watch anything. The loading logo just keeps going and going but the show never starts.
For phone mode Why when pause the button not like usual?? I want like previous ver when able to pause and see whole screen not to wait like this PLEASE
"Unlike Youtube where you can choose to change the video resolution manually in the video player. Netflix only have the function to ""save data"" in the setting under ""celullar data usage"" so user dun really hv a choice over the video resolution. User pay for something that they cannot change/control according to their need. What a shame.."
"I like the mobile version and everything works fine, but on my Roku TV Netflix is consistently lagging severely during movies and it never used to. My internet service hasn't changed or anything, so maybe it is a recent update or something causing the problem but I would like to see it fixed please. Then I can change the three stars to a 5-star rating."
"After the 1 household update I can't watch Netflix on my phone anymore but have no problem logging in and watching it on my computer which is in the same house and both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi. I signed out and back again but the issue still remains. Also, this started happening just now. Tried googling the answer but couldn't find anything"
"Why my Netflix is slow motion everytime that I watch movies and cartoons. Just asking I will change my ratings if my Netflix is in Normal and not slow motion. Wow amazing it becomes a little faster now, I will add a One star for that. I will give a five star if the video becomes Normal to watch."
"I thought this was a very good app, but I don't think it still is very good. Always when I'm watching something and I'll go check a message or something outside the app while I'm watching something, when I come back the app keep loading and stuck in it. It's like I don't have internet connection anymore. It's very annoying because sometimes I go check a important message and when I come back the video is stuck in loading. And sometimes it even restart the video from the beginning."
"Its working fine on my phone, ipad, and laptop! However, it is often slow when I use it on my tv. It also often crashes to the point I can't finish shows. It happens often and it's very annoying. It's expensive and you're telling me it doesn't always work? Please fix ASAP."
"Think the range available, the quality isnt as good as it used to be. They appear to be spending a bit too much time and subscription money putting games on the app, and putting them right in my face. I think this lessens the value of my subscription. NetFLIX not netGAMES, stick to what you are good at."
"Why can't we make payments and control most aspects of use through the app like many streaming providers in 2023 allow us to do? If I'm using Netflix on my phone, I should be able to set up payments, control settings, and so forth in the app instead of through the clunky website on my mobile or having to use a PC. With the current extortionate prices, this app functionality isn't too much to ask."
"Your brightness slider jumps down when I catch it and try to slightly readjust the brightness. When I click on screen to show all the controls, the brightness slider is a little above the middle of the screen because of the duration slider at the bottom. When I press the brightness slider, every other ui disappears, as it should, but the brightness slider moves down and this changes the brightness level since my finger is on that slider that just shifted places. It should stay at the same place."
Absolutely love Netflix but I hate that things keep getting removed. The movie home was my little mans favorite movie and it was removed and so he started watching sing 2 and now it is being removed. He only watches certain things and these two movies are only or were only on Netflix. It's a bot disappointing to keep losing his favorite movies. Please bring them both back and keep them
"While I appreciate Netflix, my rating is constrained to three stars. I am puzzled as to why Netflix persists in displaying subtitles and translating them into Tagalog when characters converse in English, contrary to my explicit preference for no subtitles. Kindly remove subtitles when I opt for subtitles off, particularly considering the English-speaking context of Filipino movies and shows."
"What's wrong with you netflix.. I use wifi, you get error 3.1. I use cellphone signal, you still get error 3.1. My cellphone has been restarted, my Netflix has been reinstalled. I have done all your suggestions. But you still get error 3.1. Are you improving your performance, but you ignore that not everyone uses the latest cellphone that can support your new performance?"
Getting more unhappy with it all the time. I hate that they have taken ayay vidios and movies to put games and comedy skits or what ever on. Netflix is supposed to be movies. With the comments I have read I will not be updating. If it gets to a point where I have to in order to watch it. I will most likely cancel. Thank you. Charley
"Not only do subtitles frequently show only a fraction of a second, but you still refuse to provide english subtitles of only the foreign language portions. Awful list interaction if it's longer than 10 or so, where it's always refreshing/reloading forcing you to the top again."
My Netflix been working perfectly fine and for some reason the app keeps crashing or and error code keeps popping up and my bill is paid for so why is the app keeps crashing and showing an error code and now they boosted up my monthly payment now they go have me start paying $22.99 a month for the subscription starting in January like dang why go that high up
"Its a good app but my plan is a small plan so only one can watch at a time sometimes when i open netflix to watch a movie or drama it will say someone is already using Netflix even when no one is using it other than me and because of that i won't be able to watch movie or drama for hours and its so annoying, thats why i am giving 3 stars"
"Hello. First, thank you for the app. I'm having an issue with the app, There is not streaming window anymore to connect to my TV? I reset the phone and app and also update the app. The Netflix took this feature away??"
"Since the last update subtitles are now, for some reason, turned on by default, I have to go into the settings and manually turn them off every time I watch anything. Please can you fix this so that subtitles are NOT turned on by default."
latest update has issues. can no longer select SD card as a storage location. It keeps reverting to internal storage. This is on a phone and tablet. Films I downloaded before the latest update were on the SD card so now I can't view them. please fix.
"Quality of shows have gone down and it seems they trying to make up for it by getting tons of foreign movies. Also, minus 1 star due to their games are not available for android tv....really netflix?? Half of your games were pc and console games that run fine with a controller on a monitor. Why translate only to a mobile device? Make them available for android tv and 5 stars again."
"They make one more bad decision-and I'm cancelling. They raised the price, lost a lot of good shows, took away screenshots, and removed picture in picture/windowed mode. Seems with every update they take something else away, and then want more money."
Apps ok but tried to change my plan from premium one to a cheaper one and it is impossible to do so. Cancelled subscription. Don't get my money full stop now do you Netflix. UPDATE: seems like this issue has been fixed.
"Wanted to watch ""DAREDEVIL, A Netflix Original Series.... so I thought it will be available on Netflix. And when I checked. Surprisingly it's not there...it's only available on Disney Hotstar... seriously..!! (Will change the rating back to 5‚≠ê, if I get the series on Netflix)"
"I don't really have any problems with Netflix, it's a great app to have for TV shows and new or older movies, but at times it can be annoying because of the new password shareing restrictions."
"I'm not sure how the subtitles are for movies or shows in other languages, but i feel like subtitles for most netflix original anime are just horrendous, like why?? the translations and the verbal words are probably like 95% out of translation."
"It's a really good app, but it just randomly stopped working correctly, I cant even change my accounts, I'm now stuck on one account and I also can not download anything on my android tablet, I've just deleted it and whatsoever I can not download it, and idk why. please fix these issues."
For the last couple of days since an update my phone automatically puts the captions on after the screen goes to sleep while paused. Why do I need to change settings everytime I start watching something? How about leave the settings where we left them? Pixel 7
"Fixed a bunch of issues, but the mobile games are a pain. They should have stayed in their own tab. Netflix should at least give us the option of hiding the games or, at the very least, remove the inappropriate ones. I do not want to have a game for toddlers pushed at me every time I use the app."
"I love netflix. But no matter how much trouble shooting i do, it randomly stops loading properly. It can be frustrating when you pay so much to enjoy the app."
"EDIT 2023/11/18: I have control of brightness again. Good, but I can't remove the game icons from the menu!? I don't want to play. Eyesores. It deters me from using the app on my phone. 2021/09/11 The Android app has decided to take control of the screen brightness which does not really work that well."
"It's good, it just doesn't have a lot of good movies and tv shows like the originals/the vampire diaries, etc.....i think they should bring them back and put on more good if not excellent movies/tv shows. Don't get me wrong they do have some on there just don't get ride of some of the good/excellent movies/tv shows. If they do bring them back I'll give it a 4-5 stars ."
For no reason it enforces custom brightness controlls. Moreover they dont work when network is lagging and movie is buffering. No dislikes nor comments in the damn only place they are needed. imagine how usefull would they be when you are browsing for something to watch. Mindblowing. No way to select resolution. What if im on mobile network and FullHD is too expencive? I just dont get why is it a thing when such an option is a canon for video streaming apps?
"would be great if you have a proper movie/series TRAILER and REVIEWS, instead of having clips from the video. Trailers and reviews are beneficial for someone who cant decide what to watch."
"currently playing SD quality video on a tan S9 plus when the FAQ indicate the device is compatible for HD subscription. have tried all suggested ways to alleviate this pixelated playback, but so far, no solutions."
"When I was watching A series of unfortunate events, a great show, the day before it asked me are you still watching, I have to say I got a little annoyed but clicked ""don't ask again expecting it NOT to ask again. But today it asked me agian, so I think you should fix that problem. Other than that and they way I can barley find anything interesting to watch, great app"
"The Netflix app is working great in my android hand set but, I am unable to use the app on my television .For last one month,it is saying that Netflix has encountering an error.In this situation what can I do ?Please give suggestion, how I can reset my Netflix account on my Samsung QLED."
"STOP AUTO PLAYING SYSTEM SUGGESTIONS IN AUTO DOWNLOAD MENU. thanks. Auto download issue: when items are auto downloaded, they should present a discription when selected. They currently auto play when selected from the auto downloaded menu. These are suggestions from the service and I don't have a clue what they are, stop the auto play now."
Everything is good but it must have that data saver and to change quality anytime option like not everyone has a wifi at their homes. We want a data saver quality option just other out apps provided it you guys should too
"Sometimes, it is not clear in streaming on premium and requesting developers to increase the brightness for new samsung Galaxy s24 ultra as brightness is full but the content very dark"
"Kicks off app in the middle of streaming. When go back in, the show I was watching isn't under my ""Continue Watching"" row. And can't find in the search. Looked for an update to explain the glitching, but no update available."
10 min ago everything was fine but now can not watch a single thing because the loading is taking forever!!!!!
The player gets buggy after a bit. When you move to the next episode there's no subtitle
The screen brightness increases automatically to around 30 - 40% when viewing a video in pixel phones while the brightness slider is kept at its minimum point... Please fix that.. This is annoying.
"Edit: They made home the default page again, a step in the right direction. Thanks! Was a great app until games were added and put at the top of the page. Please give us an option to disable it. I never asked for this, and I don't think anyone (sane) has. They also sometimes look similar to a movie/show, which is frustrating when accidentally clicked on."
Normally netflix is really good and I love watching my favorite shows on it but lately it won't even show me what I'm watching and it does that 24/7. I'll uninstall then I'll install it again then it'll work for a day then it does it again.
"Cannot deactivate autoplay, which is mightily annoying, and downloaded episodes expire."
I swear! If you guys force me to pay to watch ads I'll drop you like a bad habit. Your content hasn't been great lately anyways.
"Would be better to allow decrese screen brightness in full screen mode , it is discomfort in dark rooms"
"I personally love Netflix because I can watch more shows and movies on it than other apps I've had, but I don't like how it removes a show when it becomes unpopular or only gives us a limited time to watch a serton show, and the app is a little laggy. My last comlant is that you now have to live in the same house hold as the person who set the app up. But other than that, this is a wonderful app and you should definitely download it if you love to watch shows and movies, when your sane?"
"Annoyed cuz Netflix often stuck loading nowadays.Happens quite often now.Bringing the rating to 3 stars cuz I Would love if you guys can add the Series LOST, add the movies Texas Chainsaw for all Parts cuz it's missing. Prison break is gone,very sad.Think Netflix really gotta bring back those old good movies that people love. Hell even XFILES and Quantico is not available .Hell even FLASH Season 9 don't have,imagine that.Pls improve."
"App works but is designed to make you poke around more than necessary, esp. when continuing to watch material."
They keep removing shows and movies. I feel like its deliberate even though some of them were absolute hits
Why take away the brilliant widget on android. It was definitely one of the best widgets in my opinion. Please bring it back üòî
This is one of the best apps but why so many movie is missing like most of the famous movie is not added here and that's a big problem something
"Today , I faced a problem in netflix...I tried to download some episodes but there is an error showing that u have too many downloads in other devices ..when I checked all other accounts, there was no downloads .. But some days before I was able to download.."
This app Netflix is not bad it has lots of interesting shows to watch but they are also disconnected when I do have internet
What I would really appreciate is if Netflix supported members to be subscribed through Google App store subscription like how other streaming services does.
"Please fix the brightness bug - it overrides all brightness settings until the app data is deleted, which deleted all downloads."
"Absolutely frustrating app. Maze like UI and irritating autoplay that takes agency away from the user. Before you've even read what a show or movie is about, the app has already started playing it. That makes me stop playing it immediately and never go back."
"I don't like this recent updates. I have different profiles for different genre. Now, it's all gone. I know i can search it. And in its differnt section. But i dont like it. I like the way it was..I cant continue watching my fav anime, my fav series. Bring back the old one.. god, please."
It's good but all the good shows and movies are getting taken off so now I don't really like Netflix anymore
This app needs a serious overall. It keeps skipping to the next episode when I open the mini player
This app is great but I cannot somehow connect to Netflix service if you may can fix this bug I would be greatfull
I wished that I can choose a plan on the app instead of going to a browser to do it also when is Eden Zero season 2 coming? both Dubbed and Original
"Some of the movies and shows were good but there weren't many of them and once I got through those, the rest were very boring."
No longer displays my continue watching on the app. Doesn't remember what I have seen and is now more concerned trying to get me to play games.
"Are you guys ever going to fix the brightness problem??? This why I never update apps. Why the hell did you guys ruin the UI? What an unnecessary, confusing change."
"Their is something technical problem occured whenever I updated or sometime watching Netflix , so I respond all this"
"Wish this was more user friendly...save future choices, show what was already watched and get it out of the way for next choice"
Movie selection was getting scarce for anything I want to view IMO. So I switched to Prime for a better selection
"Canceled my membership, and it got turned back on mysteriously. It very tight on money this month."
I cannot download as much as I want even when storage is available. Not expected from Netflix.
App seems to bug my phone out and turns the screen green sometimes. Only in this app this happens. Not loads of good stuff but good for background and some decent movies and shows.
App is very good but don't bother with any of their original content because Netflix never ends a season on anything other than a cliffhanger and then cancels most series without finishing the story. It's endlessly frustrating.
I'm not even able to download any movies or series in my profile. I tried many times but even the settings is not helpful üòï please check that
In desktop version there is no share feature. And in desktop version we we are seeing movie information and scroll do the app recommending more movies we can't open and see that movie information when we click on movie it was directly playing
It always freezes when we watch it on our tv just doeant make sense.. Coukd ya please fix this issue.. We love netflix.. If you dont we think we may have to get rid of it and we really dont want too..üôè
"I would like to appreciate you and meanwhile giving some suggestions. I always like to have an archive for what I watched, but keeping them on my list is making it too crowded, I wish it could move to another folder after I watched it. If I could search what movies would leave the app in upcoming days, I can watch them before they get removed. Some things like a button to filter and show me a list of ""leaving soon"" at the search section. I think those can turn the app to my favorite one.Thanks"
"I'll give a five if the next seasons of Fairy Tail is out in Netflix, overall good experience. 2024, still waiting."
"stop showing games. if we open this app, that's because we want to watch movies, series etc. not to play games."
Keeps disconecting my account. Everything on my phone has dark contrast. I can see my screen in the light.
I can never watch anything I can get in but then the screen freezes but overall is ok
"I don't understand what is going on. I spend half of every week with my daughter taking care of my grandson, so am on her account as a member of the household @ least 50% of the time. I make sure to log into the home wifi @ least once a month & never had a problem, now it won't let me use @ all unless logged into the wifi. Which I don't like to stay on because I don't want to accidentally connect to unsecured account & get hacked. What's going on?"
Love the app but unfortunately Search is not working for me. Please check and resolve this issue.
There is a small problem. The last 2 episodes of FRIENDS season 9 is missing. Can you please take care of that.
Some movies that I want including series are not here also please add more Animes ps: I wish Expendable 4 on Netflix too Supernatural not available in my country Philippines üáµüá≠ it keeps saying device error
After watching some series or movies... When I come back after it keeps loading even when I have a strong network
"Only 3 stars, cuz why have to cancel every good show like Gorillaz, Inside Job, Qforce, ""I am not okay with this"", and other good shows like whyyy"
"I like Netflix but I can't search for anything,always says can't connect to Netflix even tho it is"
"They need to fix their storage location, cause every time you want to use your ss card expansion for all your movies being downloaded into. It forces you to keep only using the internal storage, despite wanting it on SD"
"""Games"" are now the start screen and you cant change that. Bad experience."
Netfix is not downloading anything It is saying to update or it is saying to change parental controls which I have not set
"Can you please have english audio for anime like Naruto, Naruto shippuden, etc ? People prefer english dubbed version over japanses one."
"Meh, it's okay but do I really need a 7 minute intro to every freaking show. Definitely prefer Hulu"
"For some reason, the pause and play buttons remain on screen? Google Pixel."
"I like Netflix since, you can watch your shows but, I'm talking about the screen limit.It is that if there is more than 1 or 2 people watching thier favorite show, someone else trys to watch thier favorite show but, there is thing that says the ""screen limit"" which said that too much people are watching in your account but, what if a kid can't watch thier favorite show and don't know how to make an account and also if thier parent or guardian doesn't know how to make an account."
I love it but lately today I wanted to watch one piece live action but it wouldn't let me even all the one piece movies all except the show. Please fix this netflix
We do not have latest movies showing and why not have a system to store movies without expiring
"I use a Xiaomi brand on Android TV BOX. Netflix can't be used because the password I enter is always wrong. Netflix version 2.4.6 cannot be upgraded to the latest version because Netflix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot available on the Play Store. Even Netflix cannot be uninstalled. Then, how can I upgrade Netflix to the latest version?. Please help. Thank You."
"The brightness control is very annoying. Android OS has its own contorol, so why is there another one?"
"Really good Thriller/horror flims. But I I've ran out of those. Need to go bCk add more ""I'm a killer""type movies. I can't seem to get to far into a series before there's to Many new characters added into the mix. Live the limited series on murders and ppl who have deep trauma in their real lives. Because I have to. I relate. But over all Nexfix is my only pick 3/4 of the time. And best of all, guys haven't raised your prices that I know about no commercials. Just need more docu's"
"I am having 60 Mbps Internet link, Sometimes unable to watch anything even the downloaded videos in Netflix."
"Fixed the issue of not being able to use Netflix with my parent's account. Free games are great hope you add more soon. Got damn it Netflix, still the black screen on mobile devices?!"
"Cant search for title, some series have incomplete season and got no updates."
I like it but can you add how to train your dragons 2 the part where hiccup fightes drago ive been searching netflix for a long time i would like if you add that thank you edit:netflix you are removing too many episodes from different cartoons and some removed entirely i want to ask y are u doing this? Edit:ah yes another star gone as my favourite shows start disappearing y netflix y please give me a reason for removing all of these shows
"Can't handle being paused on Android TV, always causes an error and has to be completely reset. Has no way to clear a program out of viewing history."
"I really like it but the only yhing i dont like is that Netflix can get rid of stuff. Right now i am watching a show called pretty little lires on netflix and it leaves January 21 today is January 14 i have 1 week to finish their is 7 seasons and im on season 4, every ep is about 30 minites long. So could you plsss bring it back and mean girls. But over all i would give it 3.5 stars. -Emily"
I like it it's pretty good but I don't like that the price raises and the quality lowers and I would like it if there was a poll for which show or movie to add lose and to keep and which show to continue so please update it so we can do that I think it would be helpful
Add More Features. Example: Let me add folders. I have too many shows I want to watch & they keep getting lost in my list or currently watching. Add a To Watch List.
"Star removed because every time I sign in or the app closes even temporarily I have to turn off subtitles when I play a video. It's annoying. I tried to find a feedback area but no luck, so this is where you got it."
Problem with unpause. I unpause after 2 months. It's showing it will take 9 working days to process Payment and reinstate your account. I think netflix is having so many technical issues.
"Some good shows. However, Netflix seem to like race/gender swapped history shows which really spoils it for me as a person that cares about history. Suggest to label all such shows as ""race/gender swapped fantasies"" or something to that effect so people like me would know to avoid them."
Great app for the most part and I have no problems with it on my phone but on the TV it kicks me off when I watch certain movies/shows. That can get really annoying when your just trying to chill
It's okay but the only issue I have which wasn't taken away is the picture-in-picture feature. I really liked this feature as I like to play games on my phone as well as watch netflix
I have been a loyal customer since 2013. My month charge just went up without warning. We hardly get anything new and I'm already at the most basic plan. Keep raising your prices especially without notification and you will loose this long time customer.
Netflix been having issues on my devices. It either takes while to load or kicks me off when trying to watch something. Please fix issue for all device that Netflix can use on
"I would have loved to give 5 stars for the experience and quality of useful content but having the most highly priced subscription plan, monthly 649 is really high for the frequency of watchable content releases from an Indian viewer perspective. Either the cost or frequency needs improvement for a TV user."
Only 3 stars just because you don't care about caption customization. It is too small and no drop shadow or background options. What's new is always the same... Honey badger does not care!
"You should definitely improve content descriptions. I have been seeing a lot of ""This [movie type] featuring [someone unknown] was directed [someone else even less known]."" Whoever was trying to be smart doesn't help the viewers at all. Just write a one line synopsis!"
"Please can you bring back dinosaur king? Because that was my favourite show when I was a little kid and I was always made fun about at school and It always made me upset. So I watch. Dinosaur, king, and it actually help me a lot more and now it's gone. I'm still upset and on 12 years old. Please bring your backs so I can have my child who back. Cause I'm still getting me fun. And anyway, it always makes me feel good about myself. And it always Bette even in the toughest. Please bring it back"
Netflix is alright I guess but it keeps removing shows that people like just because of money I mean I know that money is important for a business to run but honestly they don't need that much! I'm disappointed in what they have removed and what they have changed but I can live with it I guess.
"Streaming works flawlessly, but I recently cant use the app, because the quality randomly switches to 240p or the homepage will just not load. Same gies for the search."
"Programs are missing, you can click on them and the episodes are not there, profile picture got set to default. Please fix it in next updated."
The recent addition of mobile games has become a nuisance and uninteresting. It is HIGHLY annoying that the app is trying to shove mobile games down your throat. I wish there was a feature to disable that section and mobile game recommendations.
"This reason show why I picked3 3/5 of stars.First when I download it,it takes forever and its on my computer.I really reccomend Netflix to fix their lag because when I was watching a tv serise it was doig do loading screen.If you can fix it please do.Thank you!"
The videos aren't displaying fully on my screen. I'm having to watch movies on left side of my phone screen. The right side is just black
Sometimes it suddenly closes. I suggest you put adjusted volume in screen play so it would easier for your audience to adjust volume.
"faced issue of device limit. I updated app,chngd pwd, restartd phone but no luck. now trying reinstalling app. pls fix it netflix. it worked last time with reinstall but again getting same even after signed out all devices."
"I am using Samsung s22 ultra and suddenly in playback setting I am getting Widevine L3 and No HDR support issue. Kindly fix this issue as soon as possible, it is reducing my viewing experience."
"Facing an issue. When I received any call or use any other app while using Netflix. After the call, Netflix didn't run video until restart my mobile."
I love the app but all the of my favorite shows that were on there are now gone. I would like for you you to bring back downloads so that way everyone with a device can watch stuff with out wifi.
Increasingly bloated; harder and harder to simply watch something without being pestered. Thumbs-down have no real effect; you will watch Netflix-produced content and you will like it. Harder and harder to justify paying for.
"these glitches are annoying bro. subtitles, ratings, simple updates."
"It's great that the apps have added the filter for my list section so the viewer can watch according to their preference. But it would be great that it have another filter that sort the list. For example, the date added to the list cam be sort from the recent to oldest or vice versa. And since the update, whenever i want to scroll my list, it just keep loading."
"When casting to a chromcast, the app plays trailers in the background. Extremely annoying."
Why can't I watch videos during call on netflix? Like I used to watch before.
"taking off all my favourite shows, don't post full seasons, has dead movies, is alright."
Latest update has not been working well with my phone. Samsung Galaxy A33 5G
I love it but some of the movie were removed and it sucks and this is the best mov app.
when i download move in Netflix the speed of downloading is to slow but my wifi speed is normal
"Please I can't display over app,I can't reply a message n watch at d side of my fone at the same time,can u help me fix it,Iv already allowed permission"
"Need a feature where I can choose to grey out movies I have already watched, it's so hard to find something I haven't already seen"
I love Netflix but you could get some English language for alot of people I don't like to read it because it ruins the whole thing
I gave it a 3 because it does have alot of verity in shows and movies. But my only problem is that when new releases come the old movies are ready to leave out. It makes me sad because Netflix was the only show that reminds me of old movie childhood. I do recommend for some old movies and shows to come back on netflix.
Now they have commercials. Smh they were the best streaming app. Had to give 3 stars bcuz they added commercials
I use to watch Netflix but I don't think. There's anything good to watch now but Great animatingn.
I have really terrible bad experience with netflix. I give 2 stars because of shows and movies of Netflix they are perfect. i start it as a new and in payment I do with visa card but it doesn't work at all. everything was correct and there is not other methods available for payment and I am so angry on them and they don't even give gift cards in my country because of less subscription in it. so Netflix you are so terrible bad.
"It's a cool app when I first started using it, but now it doesn't have most of the movies you search for, but it's still got cool ones, tho"
It's great but I can't download anything as it would just stop downloading like half way
Are you still wantching not working as of a week or 2 ago. Just keeps playing constantly.
Works fine until alot of my smart downloads suddenly disappeared and when tried contacting live agent was informed that is because i updated my phone/app so it's like a new device (???). Also if shows are going to be taken down would appreciate some advance informing. Would also like to have a download history as well instead of just viewing history.
"So the issue I've noticed: off a fresh install, I can download 20+ episodes of a show, no problem. Once I've watched them, I delete the ones I've watched and download more. Except Netflix doesn't see I've deleted them, so after a week I can only download 1 episode before it says I have ""too many downloads"" and I have to delete the App and re-install. Very annoying."
I have had Netflix for years & it's been great....until about 6 months ago...now during each episode of a series or a movie there is some kind of glitch that cause Netflix to freeze up 2 times in a row. I watch Netflix everyday!!! And when I'm paying for a service I just feel that it shouldn't be freezing up this way. I hope that this Technical Issue can be fixed!!! Thanks Barbara
"Usually, the app is fine. I can watch the shows without hurdle. But recently, it gets glitchy in some part of the shows. The sound will get going but the screen's froze. Sometimes it happens in important scene, too. I was fine before, but as it getting more glitchy than before, i got annoyed. I hope you can resolve this issue. If not, i might leave to another playform"
"Absolutely loved Netflix.. UNTIL today. Yesterday I started watching something and it started bugging. The picture would pause but the movie carry on playing, could still hear all that was going on in the movie. So I optimised my phones maintenance to 100%, no issues but it didn't fix the problem, so I came on and updated Netflix to see if that was the problem. And it's made it worse! I'm stoll having the same problem but now the picture isn't moving AT ALL and it's taking forever to load despite having a good Wi-Fi connection, I've got no downloads either. I then rebooted the app, and soon as I came back on it said device error and logged me out? I logged back in, tried playing the title and the movie was even worse!! Please sort this before you lose another loyal customer üò° I've tried everything with my phone, and its a very new phone being the Samsung s9, fully updated, and it isn't happening with any other apps so this is definitely down to the Netflix server!"
"Netflix has some great shows,but im disappointed in its promotion of gratuitous sex withiut warning (hard for me to let kids have access despite their own profiles). Also, many of the shows are overtly propagandistic and I feel like I'm listening to a clueless 19 year old lecturing me. I just want to escape when I'm watching a show. Aside from that, some of the original programming is superb, and the recommendation algorithm is decent. Another star off for not allowing rating of shows."
"Netflix has made entertainment on the go quite a dream. The sign up, log in, search, content suggestions and smart downloads are speedy and efficient. The UI is also prettier than Amazon Prime and HBO. But that dream occasionally slips into a nightmare plagued by download errors that make no sense, and jerky playback that are random and hard to track down. And with their level of customer service, you'll never get answers to these problems. Oh well, just stick to desktop and torrent, right?"
"Netflix has plenty of great shows and movies to watch, but lately the app has been giving me a lot of issues. Primarily, shows will just disappear from my ""continue watching"" list and it won't show up when I search for it. If I access Netflix from my PC, the show will still be there, but not on the mobile app. Nothing seems to fix the problem, but the show does eventually reappear after a few hours/ days. It's a really frustrating problem that I hope will be fixed ASAP."
"The app is great. However, they lack of good movies that is worth my time. As a film enthusiast, I can see that Netflix focuses more on korean series which is understandable because 80% of the population around the world demands it. But, they tend to forget that some subscribers has their own preferences. So, it'll be much better if they add more binge worthy films with more different genres, especially horror ones."
"mostly love this app, great on road trips, which is daily for me for work. however, the ability for the main menu screen to rotate with the phone would be of great help, my phone is mostly clamped into a phone mount on its side for most applications, but trying to figure out what to watch when the main screen is sideways is infuriating. the screen will flip when I'm watching and on occasion when I first start it up it's how it should be, but quickly flips back to upright, making it hard to select"
"Netflix is a good app to watch good shows and movies, but there are some cons to it. First, the prices, when I first got Netflix it was $9.99 a month, but now it's $12.99. Second, the movies and shows kind of get boring after a little while. Lastly, the information that cab be taken from it. An example is my friend was using her Netflix account one day, to find out someone had hacked in and was using her Netflix. They even found her card information. That's why I'm giving Netflix 3 stars."
"The Netflix app is easy to navigate. I've never had a problem with it. The 3‚≠ê's is not because of the app, it's because of Netflix in general. I am not exaggerating when I say this; I swear it seems like every movie I want to see, every TV show I want to watch....IS NEVER THERE! It's very frustrating. I end up having to sift through all of the movies and TV shows that are there, trying to decide what to watch because what I really wanted to watch is nowhere to be found......ever."
"I've been having frequent issues that when i turn to Netflix 1/2 the time i have NO SOUND. I have to shut Netflix or the TV & when started again it usually works. Also have buffering issues. Right now it will not work with TV/Amazon fire stick. About 1-2 times a month I think I'm going to watch a movie, Everytime that's when it will not work. My friend that watches it here daily occasionally has these issues. it's a pain. i just want things to work, like the programs."
"On top of cutting unoriginal content, ending Daredevil, and planning to add commercials, executives decide it needs a price hike? I'm done. This app hasn't been worth it in years. I honestly can't tell you why I've been paying for it up to this point, especially when free apps deliver just as much content as Netflix does all together. This is my last month. +++Plus there's also other ""free"" apps that have 1000x as much content as Netflix and even host Netflix originals. ;)"
"I use this app a lot and I think it's pretty good,but......... If you are the only person using the account it really gets annoying that every time I open the app Netflix asks who is watching! Seriously?! Also the app does not play every widescreen movie correctly, instead of having black bars above and below the movie, it cuts of the sides so I miss a lot of what's going on. So if that happens I have to go to the Netflix website to watch the movie"
Netflix is a great app but I had to give it 3 stars beacuse it took so long to load and it went fuzzy and blurry when I tried to watch anything. I had to stop mid way through an episode to restart my phone and re enter Netflix. This might just be me but this was a bug turn off for me. Other than this it offers great shows and movies totally recommended this app :)
So I've had Netflix for years. Always loved it. Over the years I've seen the various changes. Some good some not. I've also seen the price increases. Every 2 years it goes up by at minimum ¬£1. This time a year later instead of 2 it's going up again. With the cost of living crisis I find this pretty bad. This is my only luxury but afraid I will have to maybe cancel now. I'm barely surviving eating once per say and wrapping up. Alot of people are looking to cancel due to cost. Shame really.
"App connection is terrible. I use the app on my phone and cast whatever I watch onto Chromecast. When my phone display shuts off, so does the connection of the app. My phone is set to run wifi even when the display is off. I need relaunch the app multiple times before it can reconnect to Chromecast. Fix this please. Also update your movies list."
"I very rarely watch TV, and rely on Netflix, hulu & YouTube for my main sources of entertainment. I have been unable to watch Netflix at all during the day, for the last few month, because the images are so dark it's impossible to see. (This is with my phone at its brightest setting) I have absolutely no issues with Hulu or YouTube, and because I can only hear what's going on, Netflix is now my least favorite app. If It's not night time, with all but one of my lights off; I can't watch anything."
"Even though the application is amazing for watching shows, They don't really have all the shows and movies, I've been having some problems while using the app. Such as; your screen turning completely black, The screen lags but the audio resumes, Some shows may have been removed from the application which is not good. Iwas watching them and they some why disappear. Please fix these bugs because it's kind of annoying to be enjoying your show and next day its just deleted. Thank you, Netflix."
"I love all of the different shows and movies, don't get me wrong but as an app it can be frustrating. The part where you can pause and rewind the movie is constantly disappearing. Hulu by contrast is much more user friendly. There are countless times on Netflix where I had to search the app, find my show/movie press play again for the pause screen to show up. It's frustrating and slow and I really wish they would fix it. Other than that, it's a good app!"
"Was great, but what happened? I use it all the time to throw shows to my chromecast. It use to work great and stay connected, but ever since I got my new phone, a GS9, it wont stay connected well. Often while watching a show. I have no way to get back to the show controls and pause or fast forward or whatever. It also doesn't track what I've watched or how far anymore most of the time. It's really annoying to work with. It still does work, so that's good, but really annoying for having control of the show during playback. Please fix! I'll update my rating when it works well again. Thanks!"
"Overall this is a great app with a really good selection of content. The one issue is that casting is always a problem. The pause/ play function rarely shows over the lock screen. Sometimes the app will cast but within the app, won't show a connection to the casting devices, so you can't pause/ play. Closing the app & restarting rarely works to fix the issue. It's very frustrating."
"The Netflix Android app has a lot of annoyances that you can't disable. When you look at a list of episodes in a show, half the screen is taken up by an auto-playing video preview. At the end of each episode, Netflix automatically skips to the next episode and you can't turn it off. This is twice as annoying with Chromecast, because by the time your phone is unlocked, the ending was already skipped. And they got rid of the ""resume watching"" section."
"Normally a great and reliable app. But lately I've been having issues removing watched items from my list. They say that they have been removed but then seem to reappear. I've tried a device restart, and also tried to update the app, but I keep getting an error (903 and then 907) despite clearing my cache and having a strong wifi connection. Any suggestions?"
"What is going on with Netflix app lately. Its forgetting my place when returning to programs I'm watching. THE MOST ANNOYING ISSUE though is constant (and often repeating) switching off the subtitles!! When I come out of watching something, having g already switch off subtitles, there they are again when I go back into same program? Why is it individual switch offs, and not 1 switch off for the each profile? Also, how can I block content by genre? Fed up of seeing media I have no interest."
Everything was fine until last week when I couldn't open any of my downloads ( problem with video error). Over 60 episodes of different TV shows and none of it playable. Streaming stopped working also( another error).After calling Netflix they advised to uninstall and reinstall the app again. I could think about it myself but I wanted to save my downloads ( have no wifi so downloads are precious). Sadly ended up losing all of my downloads( after having no choice but reinstalling) so not happyüò¢
"Th service is ok, indeed some movies/shows are missing, but I can live with that. What is really frustrating is that Netflix is missing the option ALREADY watched and it keeps bugging you with the same movie/show each time you open it. The idea of promoting certain products on your site/app is great, but for the love of God, add an option of marking the items as watched. Maybe there is one and I haven't found it."
"It used to show me the episodes that I had already watched or how far along I was on each episode and now it does not do that. It would be nice if you could mark wich episodes you watched, the times you've watched them, etc. It's almost impossible for me to keep up track of all this with my busy schedule. Please work on this issues. Thank you. Gave it 3 stars. Will rate 5 stars once that problem is solved."
Easily the best streaming app by far. However I'm posting a review with -1 stars because of a recent issue I've noticed while streaming from the app: Massive battery drain (up to 1% every few minutes) causing my phone to get extremely hot to the touch. At first I didn't know what was causing my phone to overheat and it took a long time to narrow it down to Netflix. Never had any other app cause overheating like this (except for 3D games). So -2 until Netflix fixes this issue.
"Netflix is a great app. Only annoyance is when I cast a show to the TV and close out of the app and go to something else, when I go back into Netflix it won't recognize that I'm already connected. I then have to force quit the app, go back into it, then it will show me connected. Lastly, I don't know if this is a design flaw or an android thing, but the iPhone app gives you the prompt to go on to the next episode in a series and so far my S10+ doesn't"
"Love Netflix, hate the app! Please please please fix the bug when you press play on something the screen immediately goes black but the audio/subtitles works fine. It happens constantly. I've updated the app. I've exited and reopened it again. The only way to watch it is on the tiny screen at the corner of your smartphone which is pointless. It's getting on my nerves now!"
"It's a really good watching app even tho it's kinda expensive but it was worth it. The thing is that when I was traveleling with my family, all of my downloaded shows can't be watched because under 24 minutes-1 episode I'm watching, my data was already finished. I would suggest that whatever the downloaded episode is, it can be saved in ""My files""/"" Gallery"" or ""One Drive"" so for the people who travels including me maybe could still watch the downloaded show/movies/episode without lag or worst"
"Did not like this app because: 1. It has poor interface with small number of features, set of which is the tiniest I have ever seen in similar apps 2. It doesn't have a field for searching movies, can you imagine that? 3. When you scroll a list of movies, tap one and then return back it doesn't save position of scrolling so you have to scroll again 4. the service in whole has very small assortiment of content - I am not able to find something interesting for me"
"I like the shows and stuff, but sometimes when I try to watch something, it only gives me a blank black screen. There's audio and subtitles, but it's kinda worthless if theres no video. I'm paying to watch Pok√©mon, not to enter a blindness simulator. I already checked the wifi, it's working great with four bars and a connection on every other app. Please fix this."
Yeah it's what you'd expect. I don't use this app on my phone very much except when I need to stream something when I can't use my laptop. Casting to a TV works well but the process can be finicky cause it doesn't communicate with the user well. My biggest peeve with this app is that it notifies me when a new series/movie is coming out but the only interaction I can make is to see the trailer (which I don't do) Would be better if I could add to watchlist like that cause I usually forget about it
"The app itself is fine. I haven't experienced any problems with any video or audio on the app. The resolution is also quite good. HOWEVER, I hate the subtitles on the app. It's basically ILLEGIBLE. Which is actually disgusting considering Netflix offers many shows & movies in languages other than English. The Website subtitles work well. Just the app specifically is very bad. It makes me question whether I should actually keep my subscription. PLEASE DO BETTER!! Thank you."
"It's not a bad app, does pretty much what you would expect. How I have 2 issues with it. 1. On android there is no fast forward button. There is a back button. It makes it very annoying when you want to skip forward. Dragging the slider is very inaccurate and is not usable to skip 30 seconds. 2. The My List keeps changing order and the icon keep changing. This makes it very hard to find something you have been watching."
"In concept, I like the download feature for being on the go; perhaps the most compelling use case for this app. In reality, it seems the app often wants to ""call home"", getting stuck on the preloader indefinitely. This issue can sometimes be resolved by restarting the source device but when it's being stubborn, I'm left with a nothing more than a fancy watchlist. A lot is left to be desired when it comes to audio quality too, IMO, but that's more a criticism of the service, not the app itself."
"App is fine right now but I guess you can add additional audio features to fix the issue of dynamic range which is different on each movie because sometimes its pretty difficult to hear the dialogues due to very low dynamic range, and audio volumes varies from scene to scene a dynamic processor will help in fixing this issue..... There is same feature in Spotify which keep the audio level same for each song so basically we are looking for similar feature..... Thanks alot."
"Generally, I like the Netflix app. However, it has had continual issues with casting to Chromecast. The last problem was the casting button was directly over the stop button so you could not stop episodes. They fixed that issue it seems by making it so you don't see any ability to cast until you start watching an episode. That's okay but then for whatever reason at some point during the episode the ability to stop it or pause it disappears and we need to scramble to try figure out a way to stop it before the next episode begins. The app used to be better but they just seem to be making it worse with each update."
I like Netflix but they continuously raise the price. was just informed my plan was going up to 12.99 a month now and I don't like it that much. I got it because it was cheap. that's the only reason I keep it. I decided to switch to the basic plan for 8.99 a month and if that gets raised I'll cancel all together because it's just not worth it especially when Hulu is kinda better anyways...
"This is a really amazing app when it works, it has tons of amazing options to watch and can even give you personalized shows to fit what you like! However, I have been having issues recently... Everytime I try to access my Netflix account on mobile phone, only the sound works. You cannot see a thing, only listen to the sounds. I have restarted the app, logging out then logging back in, and even deleting the entire app and reinstalling it. Please, if there is any way you can help please do!"
"The films are good, and I am satisfied with that, but sometimes I watch programs in foreign languages and Netflix only offers subtitles in local languages which I can't speak at all. What else is Netflix that bans proxies completely. It really sucks ! You guys should always have optional subtitles according to app language instead of region."
"I like Netflix. There aren't any ads, the skip intro/recap button, and just the way it's set up is pretty good. The only problems I have is that 1. My Picture-in-Picture is broken. I've enabled it, restart my phone, and cleared my cache but nothing works. 2. I don't like how some movies or shows dissapear out of nowhere. Other than that, all good."
"I really love using netflix. However, i just cant seem to watch anything on it without having to restart my phone,which is obviously a pain and not the most ideal. As well, when I had an iPhone, I never had these problems but since I swapped it is just getting worse. I am now to the point I deleted the app as it didn't work even when restarting my phone and now it won't let me download it. I like the content though."
"Personally, I think it's a decent app. It has a lot of shows and movies. But I am experiencing glitches. For example, when I'm watching an episode, it suddenly closes. And I can't download any episodes because apparently, there are too many downloads on one device (only two out of five accounts are used.) Also it would be good if you could add a suggestion tab where you can suggest possible shows or series' to add. I hope you consider this idea and I'm hoping this gets implemented. Thank you."
"It's OK, but considering this is an app from a major company in 2018 it could be better. I don't care about recommendations that cover almost the entire screen before you scroll down. I already have a membership and the app should work for me and not try to make me watch new stuff. Another annoying thing is that you have to enter your PIN every time and there is no way to turn this off. It's my own phone with a finger print authentication, stop bothering me with the pin. And of course finally, the quality is so so. Netflix is using too low bitrates and sacrificing video quality even when its unnecessary because you have very fast internet. And also a picture in picture mode would be nice, so that you can watch shows while you do something else. All that is possible but Netflix probably doesn't care."
"Perfect in every way. Only bad thing is that it takes movies or episodes way too long to be available in certain countries because of licensing or whatever in diffrent regions. The app also has this issue where audio from whatever it is your watching keeps playing in the background even after you paused it, usually happens right after you listen to a voice note or end a call. Serious flaw."
I love netflix. Its the perfect replacement for dstv {our version of cable}. BUT i HATE the fact that i keep seeing the things i dont want to watch. Can you not make an option similar to the watch later button so we can choose to remove options we don't want to see. I feel im missing out on the goodstuff while things are being promoted that i have no interest in.
"It seems that after the last update of the app I cannot watch any content anymore. Every movie or series that I try gives me the notification ""This title is not available to watch instantly. Please try another title."" Very annoying. Ps. I'm using a Samsung tablet (Android). However, when I use Netflix on my Samsung TV (also Android) it works perfectly fine. Not sure why the app isn't working on properly on my tablet anymore."
"This is a very useful app with lots of good features, but I am giving three stars instead of five because of a very annoying glitch: the app keeps forgetting where I am up to in a video. What happens is that I will be watching a video and then leave the app to do something else. When I return and open the video again to resume where I left off instead of doing that it will take me back to the beginning of the video and I will have to scroll forward to where I was. If I had the speed changed, instead of remembering the setting it will revert to 1x speed. Worse, if I click on the ""continued watching"" instead of opening the video from downloaded videos, it will sometimes start me from a previous episode instead of the one I actually just watched. I generally watch video on my phone, downloading what I want to watch for later viewing. Please can you fix this glitch? That said, the app has many great features and Netflix has a huge library of good content."
"Netflix has the worst interface when it comes to watching movies. The pause button is way too small and located on lower left corner of screen. If you want to rewind a movie, you are in for a stressful and annoying experience. And fast-forwarding is even worse. NOTE: This review relates to my experience using the app on my Galaxy S8 tablet."
"Personally i do like Netflix. I enjoy the movies and shows and on pc and tv it works just fine. However, if i want to watch on my phone (Samsung) all i get is a black screen. The audio works just fine, so do all the setting buttons. But there's no video. I tried reinstalling. Opening/closing. But it still only shows a black screen on my phone. Please fix it!"
I love netflix but the phone app at sometimes can just be awful. At the moment when I select an episode or a movie it will either show me a black screen with audio or it will just freeze on a random scene and again just play the audio. It has been like this for a long time now. Also it will always without fail start every show and movie with subtitles even though I won't have the subtitles on. It's getting really annoying.
"It's great when it works but lately I can't get it to load past the ""Netflix"" screen. That's all that shows up and that's it. Won't load into what's available no matter how many times I clear the cache, clear data or force stop the app. Please fix for Galaxy S7 Edge. No actual issue with my account though. Can still access on my PS4, Xbox One and laptop. Just not on mobile"
"An okay app for the most part. Easy to find the shows/movies you want, video and sound is very clear and you can easily navigate the video screen to do anything you need while watching, including altering the brightness. Some issues I am having, and the reason for my rating, is when you leave the app and come back, you cannot start another video. You have to close and reopen the app. And second is this app doesn't keep track of where you were in the video when you close the app."
"It's great once it actually loads correctly. The problem I've been having is that every time I click on an episode or movie, it will freeze a few seconds in. It will continue the audio, but pause the visuals. I used to fix it by going back 10 seconds and when it gets right before the pause, open ""Episodes"" for a few seconds and then go back. This doesn't work anymore. I've also tried reloading the app, clearing cache, force stop. It just doesn't work anymore."
"Haven't downloaded offline anything from Netflix for the past few weeks due to the fact that after some time, the app refuses to let me open it. Either a quick black screen appears whilst not leaving an active window on Multitasking, or Android tells me that it's not responding even if it hasn't been opened yet. I keep reinstalling the app in order for me to use it. I've done this over 5 times(?) now, even if my phone's OS updates."
"For some weird reason I can't play downloaded videos. After about 15 seconds in, I'll just an error message with the code 5.7.1 and it sucks. I've done what's outlined in the ""Help"" article and that didn't work. While streaming, sometimes the video would freeze and you'll only get audio. If you try to rewind, you just get the frozen screen again. Other than these two issues, the app is awesome."
"I have been using Netflix for years on almost every device. It is handsdown one of the best streaming services on the market both in terms of content and design of its interface and I love it, however, within the last year or so the app has been a mess with error codes every time I accidently tap out of a tv show, rewind or use the skip intro features (Typically Error 2.1 or 1.1) and looking into it, it says to restart the app. Something I shouldn't have to do on the device I use most regularly."
"Listen, I adore this app, but I'm constantly getting chromecast issues. An app is only supposed to improve, but I've been experiencing this trouble for the past 3 months at least. My phone cannot be the problem as it's a new phone that works perfectly fine for other applications. I hope this can be fixed as this is how I watch Netflix at home on TV."
Netflix has removed the synopsis or TV show description and replaced it with silly buzz words/headings. I appreciate that the general assumption is that people who like watching TV don't like reading but I am certain that even those of us who prefer to waste their time watching rather than reading would like to know what they are wasting their time on before the fact. I'm not spending 2 hours watching a movie just because of a picture and a couple of buzzwords. At least provide an information button as an option for those who want the synopsis.
"Netflix is ok. The movie option are good but not great. They onl6 have a few great like 3 to 5 new movies and I'm talking from the previous year. All the great movies are in short supply. I like the shows. I also like how it selects liks minded movie, but I wish th ed movie selection was more updated and not movies which ard 10 years old that have been so over played on satellite/cable TV."
I've been using Netflix for years with generally no issues. In the last few days I've also started experiencing issues with the app just closing out of the movie I'm watching and going back to the home screen. Also the subtitles keep coming back on. It's very annoying and you can't enjoy watching something while this keeps happening.
"The app is great overall. Runs smoothly and is decently navigatable with ease. However, the Chromecast access button that floats ends up in a very awkward position blocking other buttons including the stop button which I can only access from my notifications menu. There is also the episode advance button that I can only access from the notification. Fixes would be greatly appreciated. 3stars as a result of these issues. Another, feature that would be great is local playback for downloads."
"There are some very basic features that a video service like this needs. Somehow netflix lacks the ability to mark shows as watched, so as to stop recommending them and putting them back in the 'continue watching' list when you've every episode. Most multi-season shows have the seasons in order, but some, including black mirror, netflix's own creation, have the seasons in reverse order, which seems to further break the 'continue watching'. It streams video fine. but is not a good video service."
"Had the app for a while but since the last update it's not been working right on my phone. The subtitles come on every new episode or every time I get out of the show and go back in. And for some reason it keeps kicking me off the show I'm watching back to where i have to select it again, usually does it in the first 25 minutes and again with only 1 or 4 minutes left in what I'm watching which is pretty annoying to be interrupted like that and have to go back in and turn off subtitles again."
"Netflix as a service is what it is, I'm not rating based on that. The app itself is pretty good, but the big problem I have right now is with the subtitles. I am watching a foreign language show with English subtitles, but they are white and appear unreadable on top of light colored backgrounds. The supposed only way to fix it is externally from the app (bad UI), but when I tried that it didn't even fix it. This should be one of the easiest things in the world for them to fix, but will they?"
"Great app but has errors that need fixing. A lot of times the watched progress of the shows I'm watching is not up to date (the app indicates I haven't watched some ep. but I actually have) and I have to keep logging out and back in again to get this updated. It happend with new episodes sometimes too, when a new one released but it didn't show on the app until I've logged out and logged back in again. This gets tiresome when I have to do this every time. I hope this gets fixed soon."
"Decent app, but... 1. Autoplaying trailers are the worst! I don't even have an option to mute them. 2. Downloadable content is quite limited. 3. When I travel my downloaded content becomes unavailable and the collection changes significantly; that doesn't make much sense to me - I'm still paying the same, have the same subscription, live in the same country etc. My other streaming apps don't do this."
"Actually happy because Netflix provides a wide range of genres and episodes to watch, but I felt more disappointed about how this app works. I can't open, search, and download IF I'M USING Wi-Fi. I don't understand why. Connection is good if you may ask. Consequently I have to browse and download through the use of mobile data which is disappointing since I have Wi-Fi connection. I hope this review will be noticed and resolved. Thank you."
"I have always enjoyed how Netflix sets up it's video streaming service compared to other sites/apps. I'm trying to decide if it's worth it to come back to Netflix, and the first thing I like to do is browse a complete list of shows/movies of a particular genre I like. However, Netflix doesn't seem to have a complete A-Z viewing option anymore, at least not in this app format. I'd definitely up the rating (and be more likely to keep my subscription) if they added this back."
"Netflix is okay. I like that the Movies are HD format, streaming is smooth n downloads occur with no hitches. Also that you able to pause a download and then continue afterwards. Cons: However the movie collections are very limited. You find yourself for the most part searching over and over just to get something useful to watch. Once you've watched the few top rated movies, you left almost nothing. Most recent movies don't even appear on the app unlike what I had earlier thought."
"I just got a brand new Note 9 and for some reason I can't get on Netflix through the app. I have tried everything. restarting my phone, deleting and reinstalling the app, and clearing the data and the cache on my phone. now if I'm really lucky occasionally it will go through. but even then on some shows the video freezes and glitches. I'm not sure what's different with this phone. I had an s9 last week and the video played perfectly. never had any issues."
"Recently had an issue with the app. Was trying to download videos then it kept saying that I had too many downloaded videos, so tried deleting all of the downloaded ones but it kept telling me the same thing. So had to go to account setting to manage downloaded videos and ""delete all videos"" (even though I didn't have any) before I could download again."
"I really like the app for the most part, but I really don't like the update where you can adjust screen brightness separately within the app. I bump it a lot on accident, and it makes it impossible to watch shows at night (on low brightness) and then to try and find something the next day when it's bright out, and Netflix is still dark. I also really wish that it wouldn't automatically turn off my blue light filter without giving me a setting to change that feature."
"The app has been awesome, until recently. Now if I leave the app after watching a series it will take me back to the original position to start watching from, meaning I have to skip forward , something's several episodes. Also the picture in picture viewing has stopped working, there doesn't seem to be anything in the settings to allow this function any longer"
"The app used to work flawlessly. Now whenever you go back in I continue watching something, it always locks up. Either the screen is black, you can still hear it, or the screen is froze on one scene or it attempts to play but fails with an error. This is guaranteed when exiting and returning to the app. Every time. Clear cache etc. And it works most of the time. Not sure what's happened in an update but a few months back it never did this."
"Developers, would you consider adding a 2√ó button üòÉ. I wanted to maximize my time with this app and would rather not watch a movie with things to do than watch something that could be finished in half the time. Many movies or shows are such slow burn. And with subtitles, and being a fast reader üòó Idk with all the other redundant features of this app (like the ""Staff Pick"", which is annoying and un-asked for). A 2√ó button seems like a no-brainer, it's a bit offbeat and irregular to end at 1.5√ó."
"Great app. But after the latest update, the option to remove a certain show from the ""Continue Watching"" section has been removed. It's quite weird also that when I finish watching the last episode of a certain series, instead of making it disappear from the said section, it just goes back to Season 1, Episode 1. Hoping they bring back the option to remove a certain show from the ""continue watching"" list without having to delete it on the Viewing Activity on the account settings, it's a hassle."
"I am okay with the app, no bugs and all. I'm not really using it much. I don't really mind having series/movies that come and go (rotation). I just don't like the feeling of watching a ""complete"" series then searching it if it's available in the app then get disappointed by not having the whole seasons. If it's publisher says it's completed either you put it in your app completely or not at all. So we don't have to search for other streaming app midway."
"I enjoy Netflix, I like the fact you don't need a good signal to stream 1080p shows but, whenever I tab out of the viewer to check a message or something and I come back the video freezes for exactly 10 seconds, audio will still be playing. also, on my old phone. I couldn't install Netflix via the app store for some reason. so I had to download it from the internet. it's these things that make me dislike the app, Netflix itself is amazing though and I've been using it for quite some time."
Cool app. The video quality is good and i like the fact subtitle can be changed to English for foreign movies but most movies are not on Netflix and you can't even send a film to someone from Netflix. To top it all when your subscription expires you can't access movies you have downloaded which is very bad and unfair. You people need to work on that.
"This app is great for watching movies, cartoons ect. The quality is great and there's no ads and you can cast things to your TV. However, I'm experiencing a problem and it makes it impossible to watch anything. Whenever I watch anything, everything works as normal for a few moments and then it just freezes on one frame. I can still hear the sound but I can't see anything. The only way to make it stop is to click off whatever I'm watching and go back on and even then, it freezes again."
"With the latest update, using a landscape tablet has been made a nightmare with the new UI. It has been made so, unlike the promo pictures(how it used to be), program information is displayed always in a portrait manner regardless of device orientation. It also does not scale well with device screen size. I have also been having a recurring issue (not solved by any updates) where audio plays and screen is black. The content is pretty good, however a lot of shows are cancelled after 1 series"
"I absolutely love this app but I have some problems. When I turn off the subtitles they come back the next episode. And there's no option to not skip the intros for shows that have the theme song or the ""Previously on.."" At the beginning. I always have to manually go back and rewind the whole episode and I cannot get the subtitles off permanently. Will be 5 stars when fixed."
I have used Netflix for many many years. I have come to realize that the quality has diminished in some aspects. This new Netflix no longer distinguishes non English speaking movies from English-speaking movies. In the description you would tell us the language of the spoken word This can be very frustrating to those who only are interested into English-speaking movies. Hence the low rating.
"It's alright but I work in a factory all day for 10hrs a day, music gets a little boring at time so I like to listen to movies and all that. Our speed in there isnt great so I have to tone things down like youtube does with a selectable quality, but Netflix tries to run high quality all the time with no adjustment, so it buffers for a minute and plays 5 minutes then the cycle goes on. Other than that I love it."
"Overall a good app, but the UX for ""my list"" needs some improvements. Adding a filter for example would help a lot. E.g.: order by latest added / newest on Netflix, Filter by genre, films, series, ... Not only for the mobile or tablet app, but also the desktop version of Netflix. Also, might be an illusion, but am I actually seeing my full list? I have a lot of difficulty finding movies I recently added, hence the filter / order by. Otherwise, great app!! Improving these would definitely be a 5/5"
"It's a good app and runs fast, videos buffer faster than even YouTube sometimes. Some improvements: - the catalog is wide for newer programs but not the older backlog of programs a 90s adult might be interested in. Things like 90s cartoons a la Danny Phantom, Teen Titans, Kids Next Door are missing. This makes the platform weaker for children's entertainment especially when my kid cousins come over for example. Also, adding more movies is a must. The series segment is strong but the movie selection is simply too weak to compete - some added functionality like when you pick a show, allow users to select the name of the actor it ""stars"" to search all shows/movies with the listed actor. The program catalog is too narrow"
"Good overall, no issue on Fire stick, which is me and my family's main way to watch. Subtitles on Android app cover most of the screen, are too large to display properly and get clipped because of this. Tried changing the settings to make them easier to read as well as fix these issues by changing font style, but the instructions from your OFFICIAL WEBSITE do not work. Fix for 5*."
"I wish Netflix' app had an app preference setting for users where we can remove/edit the resume watching tab, had an option for sleep timer or had an option to unable the automatically play the next episode button, edit the font or size of subtitles, and other stuff like that. It's great, but there are a lot of small things that are inconvenient and could be improved that could absolutely make the app a better experience for users."
"Desperately need a way to blacklist shows and movies (which, for whatever personal reason, I do not want to be reminded of) so they don't keep coming up in suggestions/search results. Also want to be able to search *only in my list* or *only outside my list*. And that thing where I get taken back to the top of the page of search results after I view details on a program is infuriating. Can be ridiculously difficult to find something I know is on there but can't remember the exact title of."
Playback is better than most other streaming apps but since the past couple updates its extremely buggy when casting to my chromecast. Constantly having to restart to be able to use playback controls. Even the volume stops working. Everytime the screen turns off i have to restart the app. Sometimes that doesnt even work. Please fix and ill change the star rating
Okay app. Few bummer issues. I travel a lot. Great app for being able to watch on Planes. Downloaded movies expire too frequently or don't work at all. Also do not like the fact that netflix app controls screen brightness. So annoying when trying to use tablet outside or in bright environments. Please fix. No I don't want netflix Auto downloading shows. Especially when most dloads expire so frequently or don't work. About to uninstall. Show selection is stale.
"I love the Netflix app, it's very convenient to use during my travels but since the update I've been getting glitches where I would be watching a show and tried to skip the intro or fast forward, only to get logout from my account. I have reinstall app several time and clear all of its memory but I still get the same glitch. If that was fix then this would be a full 5 üåü"
"Please do add high caliber award winning movies and series. The classics. The highest grossing. The top rated ones. It's disappointing when I search a known good movie and series to watch, the app says you don't have them. I know there are partnerships, copyrights and all those stuff but you guys can do better in terms of expansion. It's not really unlimited as advertised, my experience is not as excellent as I expected it to be, nevertheless, I'm hoping to see some improvements in the future."
"Netflix needs to allow their subtitles to be adjusted in colour and font as they don't show up cleanly in some movies/shows and it's hard to keep up with the flow of the conversations. Also the price is quite high considering the lack of content that's actually watchable, Another area that needs vast improvement is the time it takes for new episodes and seasons to come onto the app."
"This app doesn't seem to play nice with Chrome OS. It can't remember where I paused or exited, and restarts a series I'm watching at different previous paused points within the series. Amazon Prime and HBO streaming do not have this issue. So I tend to use those streaming services more often, even if I'm interested in Netflix's programming. Yep, still sucks. Still does the same thing. If it were free, I might ignore the disruptiveness. But as a paying member, it just kinda sucks. Still sucks!"
"Not many newer movie options on the paid Netflix app. Though, I will say that ""Stranger Things"" was an amazing series but you have to wait approximately 2 years for the next series to come out which is disappointing. We need something as compelling as that series to fill in the gaps. I don't know what the budget is for your end as Netflix. I'm not trying to be the wet blanket here! You do have some good series on such as Outlander. But some of the series are really not up to par. Peace!"
"Hey so I do love Netflix. I've been using it a long time now. But I've noticed a problem. The uk and irish netflix are the same and I'm using it. But the problem is, I can hardly watch anything. Like we have hardly any shows or movies. For instance, american horror story season 9 isn't on netflix for us but in america it is. It doesn't make sense. I really hope you could add it, even the great Gatsby aswell."
"I didn't have any issues with this app until about 6 weeks ago after I filled out a survey about Netflix. Ever since then, I've had nothing but issues. The movies will stop playing, it won't reload, I have to shut down the app or restarts my phone. I'm not able to rewind or go back 10 secs, the movie will just stop. It's becoming frustrating."
"I usually really enjoy Netflix, but recently they added a ""Play something that's..."" button to make finding content for people more ""convenient"". I have looked all through the settings on where to disable it, (but to no avail) as I do not need an engine to search for content for me. It is very inconveniently placed as, when casting, it covers up the pause button as well as the play and stop buttons depending on if you have the show you're watching's window minimized or not. Please fix this..."
I've had Netflix on my phone for a while now but after Netflix updated it started acting weird. When i try to watch something there are no images and the audio keeps playing. The screen goes black and all you hear is the audio. Ive tried to delete the app and resign in but it still doesn't work. Now i can't watch Netflix on the go anymore. I have to watch it on my TV. So hopefully Netflix starts to work.
"I think we should be able to choose by ourselves the langages (audio + subtitles) we want to see when we watch movies or TV shows. As an example, I'm french, but my phone is in English and so is my Netflix app. But I find it displeasing that I can't chose french for some movies, or that I can't put English subtitles when my app is in French. Just let us choose the language we want ! It'd be better if we could chose like, the original version plus two or three other versions we want."
"Streams well and doesn't have several of the annoying ""features"" netflix has on other platforms but has several little annoyances that have crept in as updates over time. Noticeably recently the cast button has dissappeared from the main screen and now only appears if you play a title. Though I am sure netflix will refer to this as an ""improvement"" I disagree!"
"Not bad, but it urgently needs configurable subtitles, like at least the ability to change fonts, choosing bold or regular, font color, adding background, because each movie or TV show needs a different setting due to image lightness which often renders their subtitles unreadable, and if it's possible to make this setting global not just in the android app but also on browsers."
"The latest update of the app sucks. I'm the only person on my account, and before the update it opened to the main menu, now it opens so that I have to select myself from the option of me, or add profile. Also, when the app updated, it lost the settings, so I had to reselect the SD card as the storage option, and then had to download all my episodes again, because they'd vanished, can we go back to the old one instead."
"I love Netflix, no commercials!...but it's very frustrating that ONLY on mobile devices & computers can the ""playback speed"" be adjusted BUT NOT when streaming on all platforms accessible to viewing. For example, if features are added, as in 10 seconds forward and 10 seconds backwards, then it should be made available for all streaming platforms, not just mobile, not just allowed on computers, AND not just on television screens. BUT on ALL. Makes absolutely NO SENSE any other way. It's wrong!!!!"
"This should have been a great app because of a lot of film selections and good features. But the downfall is that it always logs out itself. More often that not, even if it is actually log in, when I play a video it will say that it cannot be played because I need to log in first. So I always have to log out and login again just to be able to play and watch videos. Very inconvenient."
"The app itself is easy to use and search for things to watch. I can't fault the design and usability. That's why it gets 3 stars. The content available though is very poor. Almost a year after their release, the 2 films i wanted to see were Solo and the latest Jurassic Park film. They aren't available. I also looked for the other Jurassic Park and Star Wars films. They have Rogue 1 thats all. I tried Person Of Interest....nothing. This was the same no matter what i looked for. Rubbish."
"Netflix is an easy to use streaming service with a large library of shows and movies that are high quality! Unfortunately, Netflix seems to have shifted over from shows and classics that are well known, to ""original"" content, which is content exclusively available to Netflix, and it's such a shame, it's lead to them raising their prices to $20, while that may not seem like much, competitors have done it to $6.49, with larger variety of shows. Be prepared because they will raise their price again"
"The app has been functioning great. So many movies to watch and a really great control feature but recently I've been facing some kind of challenges with the app. Ever since I updated the app, it started lagging and stops all of a sudden. If I try to open it again, it does the same thing. The app is not functioning properly ever since the update If this can be addressed, I would surely change my rating to a five starüëåüëå"
"missing a lot of features that would make it easier to use and more fun to use. these are purely my opinion. 1) a way for the users to properly give a review of releases and comment on each others reviews. 2) subgenre options, especially if the genre is also a medium such as anime. 3) let both laptop and mobile versions have the same features like being able to delete series. 4) some of your subtitles are so huge and have black backgrounds and they cover the whole screen. why??????"
"Love Nwtflix but the android app has bugs. I usually have to close and reopen the app twice before it will display the controls for the show I am streaming (use Chromecast). I also notice I have to play the show twice in order to get it to stream. I hit play, the stream icon, choose my chromecast and then it should load. I usually hit play on the show once more and it starts working. Issues showed up after last upgrade."
"I was dumb to have faith in this most recent update.. Note to the other don't update the app if everything is working fine.. Before this most recent update it was working fine on my device.. Better than fine I might say.. Hell! But now its gone to the drains.. Its stuck on portrait mode, doesn't auto rotate.. The heads up display and play/pause button constantly freezes.. I can't skip forward or backwards anymore.. Just pure nightmare.."
"I've had lots of issues playing content on my android phone. The app does not remember progress across several episodes. Sometimes, after finishing an episode, it restarts the same one instead of playing the next, even if the next one is already downloaded. This seems like such a simple but crucial feature that I don't understand how you could get this wrong."
"I would like the Netflix app to go back to NOT having separate brightness controls; I don't see what the issue was before, it worked fine. (That's one star) Also, the play button has been kinda janky lately. If I slide my notification bar down and it pauses (or switch to another screen and come back), the play button will give me a touch of haptic feedback but not do anything; the work around I've been using is just to hit the 10-second rewind button and it will start. Pixel 2 XL"
"Overall this app is clean and easy to use. Unfortunately after transitioning from my iPhone (worked fine) to Google Pixel 4a, the episodes are not staying 'played' and my account randomly marks prior played episodes as unplayed which affects the automatic next episode to be correct. I am grateful however the player on the pixel like other androids can have the player floating over other apps/windows."
"The only complaint I have is that for some reason, every once in a while the app just doesnt give me the option to stream to my chromecast. Its literally the only app with that issue, everything else streams perfectly fine. The only way I can ever resolve this issue is: turning off my phone and turning it back on, or completely uninstalling the app and then reinstalling. It's really annoying to have to do that"
Just annoying!! The new update has placed a Chromecast button to the bottom right of the screen....while convenient two things WRONG with this: 1) you cant move the button out of the way or somewhere you find more convenient....2) it covers the stop button....so plus points for trying Netflix....but step it up a notch....make the button moveable!!!!!
"The app itself works great, both versions Android and Windows 10 but I feel like for what it costs there should be more to choose from. $15.99 a month plan: my whole family should be able to use it at once, not only 2 devices at a time. Makes it hard for families on a budget & when there are so many free TV apps to choose from, you think that would be fixed. I used to pay half that for better service and variety. What happened? You cancel or remove good shows too!!"
"Good app overall, but the popup trailers for their content on the mobile version are INCREDIBLY annoying and intrusive! They are in the way, play audio when I don't want audio to play and I have no option to turn them off in the app settings... GET RID OF THEM OR GIVE ME THE OPTION TO SHUT THEM OFF!!!! They do nothing but add to the overwhelming amount of options to choose from leading me to be MORE indecisive and annoyed. I have actively decided against watching things because of them!"
"since a few months the audio isn't running in sync with the video. it's off about half a second later than the video. doesn't matter if you stream it, or download it to watch later. different audio outputs don't solve it either e.g. headphones, bluetooth or buil-in speakers. this is only on my tablet and phone on android. no issues while watching with windows on a internet browser.."
I watch netflix most of the time. But there is an error. Hearing problems. It sounds like its speaking through a pipe or microphone. Its very annoying. I tried unstalling it and restalling it but that didn't work. I also try to restart my mobile. And it still won't work. Now i watch on my TV and i don't get to enjoy netflix like i used to. It works on any other device besides my mobile. This is why it's a 3 star.
"Netflix becomes somewhat useless once you watch just about everything that has more than 2 seasons. App is just overflowing with anime, Korean series, series with 8-12 episodes and spinoffs of 80% of the stuff I already watched. Payment demands a week and a half before my bill is due, and these issues are just a start. In my opinion Netflix is derailing."
"Why option of app window resize is not provided by Netflix, when it's available for so many other apps ?"
So many movies advertised on Netflix are unavailable when I search for them.
"Netflix is netflix, full of good shows. However... Netflix has big bugs. 1. Sometimes when you pause the video, you can't resume the video until you exit and re-enter the app. 2. When watching Netflix in the media window, Netflix doesn't record what you watch. Only in fullscreen mode it will save your progress. For example, you finish EP2 then resume but in media mode, you get to EP6 and stop. Once you return to Netflix, it will show that you're only on EP2. Due to the unsaved progress..."
"There is a very low count of movies from Bollywood and india and they upload the content they like , many hit movies we want to watch is not available on it . They have to improve it , otherwise it's a waste of money ."
Each web series should dubbed in Hindi language or many other... It can also help to you promote the series
Everything is good but please dub all anime in hindi please I dont know japanese language
"Although I just pointed out that it removes movies, I still adore the app. They ought to maintain at least a few excellent series or films, regardless of the release of new ones. My family too enjoys Henry's Danger, but seasons 1-3 were removed. Or instant family, it demonstrates to me the depths of human suffering. This must be altered. Although the episodes and movies on the app are excellent, I don't think they last very long. Because I just know that I'm going to watch the episodes and movie"
"I like Netflix itself, but this app has been pure garbage the past few weeks. Viewing my downloaded episodes while on the ground works fine. But as soon as i'm up in the air, there basically a 3/4 chance that the app will screw up with ""Device Failure Occured. Please Try Again (500.-117)."" Even after restarting the app and phone, it doesnt work. As soon as I land again and have signal, it magically works and my downloaded episodes play. This leads me to conclude its the app. Not my phone."
"App will work great in perfect HD but after 4 or so episodes into a series the screen will get blurry for about 10 minutes then it stops playing and all I get is the red loading circle spinning around. The only way I found to get back to even getting Netflix to work again is to close the app and walk away for like an hour. Then it's back to business as usual, but I'm posted up in bed for a few weeks. I can't have interruptions like that. My situation is the reason Netflix was created."
"I don't understand how in 2024 you still don't have a category for ""Leaving Soon"" as an option. Also, the price increases like everyone else said. Blah, blah, blah.."
"We have had Netflix since it was disks by mail. Sad to let it go, but I don't find myself watching as much. When the price jumped to 25 a month, I had to say goodbye. So sorry to leave. It was a good run of a few decades."
"It's a decent enough streaming service. But while it works fine on my tablet, it works horribly on my Roku. I have to load it up a couple times before it'll even try to play a video. And even then it'll often just freeze and kick me out, sometimes even shutting down my TV in the process. It didn't used to do that, and no other service I use does that."
Whenever I play a movie or anything it starts loading and always remains loading it don't lay anything. I have also tried to play a movie by downloading it but it still remains the same and struck on loading screen.
"Recently I've been having some weird issues with the app. I've been rewatching a show and half the time when I press play, it will give me a black screen with a next episode button that doesn't work and a back button. I'll have to go in and out of the episode 5 to 10 times before it starts working (force closing the app doesn't help). It also occasionally launches the wrong show when I press what I want."
"The app is great, except for the cast function. I'm watching it right now and have ZERO control over it. I cant reconnect, none of the buttons work, can't pause, stop, nothing. It does this about 10 times a day. I lose my place on tv shows often because of this. I cant stop it, so it just plays until it decides to stop, regardless of whether its on my screen or not. If just has bugs and I look forward to a fix."
"Netflix is a love/hate for me. When we pay for things such as; streaming,cable,etc, we should have more setting options! We should have options to hide all Spanish speaking movies or foreign movies...sure, the details of the movies are English but the damn movie isn't. Frustrating! Hide things from continuously showing up; I know I'm never watching certain shows and tired of them being incessantly forced on me"
Recent problems with app using Samsung j7 prime. been a subscriber for almost a year.. suddenly netflix stopped working in my device. kept asking me to restart device. still nothing. called Netflix.. they said we will look into it. thank you very much. almost 1 month and still unable to use the app. amd i am still paying for access. please sort this out Netflix.
"Decent. Better than tv channels. Could use some improvements. Sometimes my list will disappear from my home screen. I wish I could have multiple lists. If playlists were a thing that would be super cool to customize marathons. Sometimes it sucks when yall remove great shows. More trigger warnings for certain movies/shows would be nice as well, especially in the horror comedy and drama genres. Also the ability to download on tvs would be nice if that isnt a feature in some already."
IWantToTypeMoreButCan't. Can you simply put something on foreign titles indicating that its in another language? That would really save a lot of frustration and time. I spend several minutes picking something to watch then hit play and its in another language. The descriptions and titles are completely English how am i Suposed to know the dialogue won't be?? SO IRRITATING. And I've been a customer for quite a few years now.
"I can watch Netflix on any device other than my phone (Revvl 4+). Everytime I go to watch a show, I get a black screen but can hear the audio playing. I have followed all the steps for ""fixing"" this issue but nothing has worked nor did Netflix support help with it either. I love this app, but I am disappointed that I can't watch on my phone."
Once a week I have to uninstall and reinstall because when I hit play the video goes so dark you can hardly see it. When I reinstall the app it goes back to normal and the brightness isn't effected...for a about a week. It has nothing to do with my phone's settings or even any settings in Netflix. It just suddenly does it. It's so frustrating! I still have no answers.
"I have to use a hotspot from my phone to get Netflix on my TV. I used to be able to view a 2 hour movie for 1GB, but when the app was updated several months ago I noticed a change in my usage. A 2 hour show now takes up 7GB of my monthly 40GB. I can't slow the speed or go from HD to SD. I'm on a fixed income and that's almost a ¬º of my monthly allotment. I spent a total of 4¬Ω hours today trying to change the settings. What can you do to help? I love the shows on Netflix, but this really sucks."
"In general, Netflix is a very convenient app for entertainment, simple layout and provides a pretty good amount of watch time (depending on your film selection) but like many others have said, the app definitely needs to have a more vast selection of movies. Majority of the current movies are old classical movies, 90s movies, 'overviewed' movies, and others that aren't the most relevant taste nowadays."
"I love Netflix and use it often but just downloaded this version for my Chromebook and cannot scroll to browse the selection - it comes up with one option for me (series, film, etc.) on the main homescreen but then I cannot go anywhere else unless I know what I'm looking to watch via the search bar. EDIT: If you are using a chromebook, scroll with two fingers and it will work."
"Eh. The Tubi app, which is free, has the option to remove a show/move from your watch list after you started watching and discovered you didnt like it. This Paid app. should do the same. Not to mention I do have a little trouble with loading issues, but I think it could be the device I am running it off of. The lack of seasons to tv shows tht you know that there is nore more seasons to be had ha been an issue with us. Otherwise its alright."
"The app is fine except for the insistence that I continue watching shows I either never started or down voted after one or two episodes. An ability to manually remove shows from the ""continue watching"". It would also be great if, after reaching the last episode, shows didn't turn up in ""continue watching"" Season 1 Ep 1. Maybe an ability to manually mark individual episodes/seasons as viewed."
"great app and great service, a bit of a rip off with the regional limitations and cancelling amazing shows but continuing to make really bad ones. however, i've had a recurring problem with this app on multiple phones, the video is often extremely laggy and takes a good half hour of closing and opening the app to actually be able to start watching a show/movie on my mobile without the screen freezing and audio continuing. it's ridiculously annoying, would like to see a fix soon."
"Yeah, it used to be good. Ever since the latest update whenever I watch something the stupid menu (pause button, subtitles, playback speed, etc) will not go away when I tap the screen like it does for literally any other video playing app/site. It has annoyed me so much at this point that 3 stars is all you get until this gets fixed. I thought you were better than this Netflix"
"The new updates for the phone is cool, I can now change the speed and stuff, but I wanna change some settings. Such as whenever I change my volume on my phone, it pauses whatever I'm watching. How am I supposed to know if its good enough? Another thing, whenever I want to rewind for 10 seconds, it doesnt automatically do it anymore. I'd have to rewind 10secs, itd go back for 20, and I'd have to add 10secs. It's annoying especially cause this is on tv."
"I know it might be out of support, but I'm experiencing an infinite loop when trying to log in: Android 6.0.1, and my Google account tries to log me in from saved passwords. When hitting continue, I'm greeted with the same screen, and no login. Cannot use the app, either make this version unsupported, or sort this one out. Shoot if you have any questions"
"The application itself works well and seems very stable and reliable. My main gripe is that whenever an update is released, the developers actually don't tell you what's been changed and/or fixed; they just use a trite, quite patronising statement to the effect of ""you just keep watching, we'll do the background stuff"". People aren't generally idiots, so please don't treat us like we are."
"Overall a good app but I wish the option to remove things from my watch list was there.. I remember there being one but it's gone now and it's super annoying because sometimes when I've finished a show, it still stays on my resume watching list and clogs up the entire thing, please fix this in your next update.. I'd also really like a separate tab under the settings one that has a list of all the shows and films I've watched because they only show up on my ""watch it again"" recommendations."
"The app is good, but the integration of Chromecast is really buggy. The mini controller disappear something and it's not possible to play/pause even if the icon of the Chromecast says that the device is connected, I have to kill the app and run it again to make it work. A little bit frustrating for a service that costs me 14‚Ç¨ per month."
"The app is nice, download content area is also good, but for $5.99 I got Hulu, with high quality streaming. Even the low quality mode of Hulu looks better that the low of Netflix, and they want $8... lost Lucifer, but... I have Married with children, old show, but great :) / Now that Hulu is part of Disney, the service works great, and the app was improved a lot. Now makes more sense to stay with Hulu. And Hulu gives special prices to clients to return, I got a year for $24 :)"
"There's should be option for Netflix Prepaid, Indians are used to have control over their expenses. These Monthly Auto-pay Subscriptions feels like I have no control over expenses. Just bring an option for Prepaid Recharge in India!!"
Black mirror was literally the best show. For years!!! No show could touch it!!! But now..7 years later from season five to six. The bussy hive-mind virus has made this new season un-watchable. This show was SOOO creative!!! Beyond any normal day to day people. Like myself!!! Never seen what this world would become!!! Amazing foresight!!! But season 6... FULL mind virus literally took the best show ever. Definitely in the top ten of all time and nose dived like the castle bravo bomb. Sad
"I like it when it's working but the latest update makes things unwatchable - seconds skipped ahead or repeated over and over (tried restart phone etc). Good = good shows, huge variety, nice interface (mostly) Bad = ""My List"" is still terrible, so hard to remove movies as you have to do them one at a time and each removal puts you back at the beginning, need to have Spotify-esq playlists and mass selection."
Netflix is the best for subscriptions apps on movies but they don't have all movies I search for GHOST (deemi Moore) but can't find it please try to improve and get movies everywhere
After a few minutes of watching something it goes back to the home screen and when I start watching something the captions are automatically set on so I have to keep turning them off. Having to keep starting the episode over and over and having to keep turning the captions off over and over makes it pretty annoying. I loved the app until about a week ago when this started
"It took them a long time, but they have finally allowed users to prevent previews from automatically playing while browsing! They also finally made it easy to get to ""My List"" which is the center of the user experience. It works like the first release should have. They still force users to see featured content on launch, and the horizontal lists are akward to use. They also still skip the credits, but the app is at least usable now!"
"Clicking sound when profile is chosen is loud & needlessly obnoxious via headsets. Large display on homepage which covers nearly the entire screen is equally obnoxious. I don't care what's popular with other people, and I saw the movie years ago at the theater already. Finally, I use to love how video stores had a section for foreign films when I desired them. Having them mixed in with everything else, wastes my time when I don't have the attention span for reading subtitles, delaying selection."
"The app overrides my phone brightness, it is highly annoying, and takes away from the viewing experience when the screen is so bright it's hard to look at. The adjustment on the viewing screen, even all the way down, is still too bright. When I exit the app, my phone readjusts to the correct and comfortable brightness. Turning my phone brightness down doesn't help bc when I hit play it overrides again. Please find a fix for this it's ridiculous üò≠"
"The subtitles just turn off sometimes. I don't understand that, nothing I do fixes it, and I can promise that it's not my phone, as I just got a new one and have actually been having this problem on all devices. It has nothing to do with preference settings either, so maybe that would be something to look into. There aren't many things either, but I guess it's moreover a hit or miss with this app, at this point."
"I think users should have more control over the lists that claim to know what we want to watch. The recommended movies are nothing that I would ever like to see. The fact that I can't delete movies that constantly pop up is annoying to me. Users should be able to like or dislike movies to control all the random lists that are in the app. The disliked movies should never come up in any kind of list. Also, I would very much like to be able to delete a movie off my watch again or continue watching."
"I love this service, bc I don't watch Tv often, so can choose what I want when I want. i wish it would stay more consistent and not be constantly buffering though...could work on that some...and I'm not happy that you kept charging the wrong card acct AND my other acct for the same Netflix acct, causing an overdraft in one of them. There is one acct for 2 phones, not 2 of them..and answer your customer service when I try to call you on this...for now you get 3 stars till you refund me..."
A service that is trying its hardest to inconvenience its users and make the experience less pleasant for people that have to go about their lives while watching shows and movies.
"I usually love Netflix but as an avid viewer of foreign media, the inability to customize subtitles/captions grinds my gears. Anytime there is white where the captions should be, the captions just dissappear since there is no shadowing or outline on them. This is also a huge accessibility issue for Hard of hearing/deaf folks. If there is a customize option, it is too difficult to find to be accessible."
"Its okay. I appreciate being able to suggest for shows and half the time, they are able to provide the shows in a timely manner. I like some of the variety shows that they are bringing out these days. A lot of classic shows that I used to love are slowly moving away from Netflix to another platform, which I find sad. One improvement that would be really helpful is displaying the subtitles even when the app is shown in the pop-up view on the phone. Thank you!"
"Overall, the app is pretty good. User friendly, responsive. But recently it has taken over my phone's brightness settings and increases the phone brightness to maximum. When I watch Netflix on my phone, it's typically in a plane or my bedroom, both terrible places to have brightness cranked all the way up. I'm assuming this was their response to people complaining about content being too dark, but it was a half baked bandaid rather than fixing how they encoder video..."
It's a good app for movies but it doesn't show all the movies and shows which is sad
"I like the app, I don't have any issues, much better than my Crave app which lags all the time and the price isn't too bad either ! **Update** Whenever I use the app or another episode starts, I always have to stop and take the subtitles off, because they turn on automatically, this just started happening, about 2 weeks now, and I'm not very impressed üòí it's a bit annoying.**Update** I might just cancel my subscription, there isn't much new content, Netflix has gotten ""boring"" for me right now"
"Been had Netflix for years. Through the price hikes and all. Netflix has been experiencing problems and none of the titles will play today, and it does it every other day. High call volume has them not answering the phones, and a pre recorded message tells you to check the online help section. I pay faithfully every month...a few days of not being able to watch movies should have them giving customers a free month. If I don't pay, they stop my account. If the movies don't play, I still gotta pay"
"The app is good but for a company as successful as Netflix, I'm surprised it's not better. There's no big glaring problems but there are some kind of annoying little things. Probably the thing that bothers me the most is the ""rewind"" feature. They have a button to skip backwards 30 sec but when you want to go back just a few seconds there's no good way to do it. Plus there's not a skip forward option. I like the way Amazon does it best: 10 sec forwards or back. It's nothing huge though"
"I think that netflix on the computer/laptop is good and fast, but the download is very slow and it doesn't have all the seasons in certain series. For example ""friends"", one of my favorite shows on netflix, has all ten seasons. But ""doctor who"" has only seasons 5-10, which I think is stupid because you can't know what's going on. All in all it's a good app. I give it a 7/10."
"Need a feature that forces videos to play at a specific quality. I live in a country where data costs a lot. On top of my monthly subscription, I'd have to pay a lot for the data, which makes me reluctant to renew my subscription every month. I'd really appreciate if you can add a feature that forces videos to play on a chosen video quality. I already changed my video quality setting on the account page but all it probably does is choose a preferred minimum video quality."
"Great app, but whenever I connect / disconnect a bluetooth or USB input device like mouse or keyboard, the app refreshes and takes me to the timestamp where I started watching when i opened this app. Sometimes I've been watching consistently for 2 episodes (via smart download), and when my bluetooth keyboard is connected or disconnected, it takes me to the previous episode where I started. All experience except this has been great. Thanks Netflix team!"
"This app is really a pain to use with Chromecast. Sometimes it won't connect, sometimes the controls disappear, sometimes it refuses to disconnect. Well, pretty much nothing works as it should. Not sure what happened, this app used to be way better than the competition but now it's another case of good content with a crappy app. Not cool."
"Can't review the desktop app so here's where I'm making a suggestion. Please turn off the auto play feature for the opening advertisement. It is now a behind the scenes look at a show I've never heard of. I think this is a terrible place and a terrible way to advertise something brand new. At least if it didn't autoplay i wouldn't be subjected to it just for starting your app. I've been moving away from Netflix over to Hulu and Amazon anyway, so not starting the app at all is getting easier."
"Ever since I updated with the update that has the brightness adjuster in app I've been having a lot of difficulty. It never seems bright enough even at max and locks my phones brightness display so I have to pull away from the app to adjust it in order for the screen to be seen. Not only that but for some reason it progressively looks like a blue light filter is being turned on to the point where, whatever I'm watching, 5min in looks bathed in yellow which is extremely distracting. Fix this"
Brightness control at minimum level is tooooo Bright. Cant watch in full darkness. Android.
"Please fix the chromecast feature. This app used to work flawlessly when casting and now it acts like it's not casting anymore seconds after the stream starts. This makes it impossible to pause or play the stream, continue when Netflix asks if I'm still here and makes it difficult for an older audience to understand. I'm tired of my mom calling to ask how to use the Netflix. Please fix this or I'll be forced to cancel my subscription. The frustration outweighs any benefit."
"When my finger accidentally rests on the fingerprint sensor while a video is playing, the media starts stuttering as if the phone (Pixel 3a) is struggling to register the print while playing the video. I tested w YouTube app and the same does NOT happen. Additionally, screenshots of media shows up as a black picture. Lastly, multitasking with Netflix is atrocious, almost consistently bugging out trying to switch from landscape to portrait (autorotate off)."
"In general, I like the Netflix service, and it works well. My problems with the app are: 1) The constant change of category order in the in the app is annoying. 2) I can't find a setting to disable autoplay of trailers in the notification section. 3) I know I have seen all of some series, but I can't see this in the app anymore. 4) I hate that I can't turn off binge watching. A note to Netflix in general, I hate that you call it a season, but there are only 6-12 episodes released per year."
"Shows very few movie choices so you have to know a movie to watch instead of being able to scroll through to find one, as well as that, the American Netflix gets much more shows and movies compared to the UK Netflix which I hardly see that as being fair... It's a very good app in general and Netflix is known by pretty much everyone, but put more shows and movies on the UK Netflix or make an option of using the American Netflix somehow, people are paying for Netflix so give access to everything."
"I'd prefer the ability to browse all titles, have a more accurate search engine as well as a real rating system on a 1-10 scale with access to a wide range of filters to toggle. I understand some user demographics have a hard time navigating the interface, offering difficulty options akin to those found in a video game (easy/normal/advanced) could win back some customers. As a user I just want more control and less algorithm based guidance. These kinds of changes will keep me on Netflix, Thanks."
"Is a streaming app, not too much science behind it, but I do like the screen block function. Unlike hulu or disney (and other apps) where if you accidently touch the screen, it might fast forward or skip the episode. BUT .... The only thing that's missing and other apps do have ... Is a RESET button!!! Is kind of annoying when you want to re-watch a series and after one episode, the following starts at the credits... So netflix PLEASE add a reset button!!!!"
"Two issues. First, the progress through an episode is not always saved properly. If I watch half an episode then come back later and finish it, it may not save and it appears that I only watched half. The other issue is with the smart download function. I absolutely love the idea, but occasionally I finish an episode and it tries to download four or five new ones instead of just the next one. It's a problem: it fills my storage with the last one and the two download per episode messes me up."
"Constantly getting a pop-up saying ""Netflix isn't responding"" with the options to close, wait, or send feedback. The thing is, the app IS responding and working fine. But no matter how many times I press ""wait"" or ""send feedback,"" the pop-up persists- over and over again, even when when a video has loaded or I have the app minimised. It renders the app useless if the only thing to get rid of the pop-up is to close the app..."
"Netflix is normally alright but just today it's playing up. All my other apps are fine so it must just be the app. I tried restarting my device, deleting the app and force stopping it but nothing worked. When ever I tap on it, it will go onto the screen that says Netflix and then it will say 'Netflix has stopped'. I open the app again and close the app and it's always the same. It will be appreciated if this can be fixed. Thank you."
"I really like the app. Only, most of the time the video quality is really bad I couldn't see the characters' faces anymore. I know it's probably poor connection but it should have been a tradeoff between a tiny bit of buffering and clear videos. Moreover, i do watch few korean, bollywood, romcoms, documentaries, but I don't know why after watching my screen got flooded with only korean movies/series when I also watch from other genres. Weird."
"My only complaint is the subtitle size. I switch between my phone and TV. I like small subs on phone and normal on the TV. It doesn't make sense that I can only change subtitle size through the web and not the app itself. It should be a basic function within the app. It's very annoying that everytime I want to switch devices I have to go through the web, which takes ages to reflect. Take some inspiration from Amazon Prime app. They let you change anything about the subs. Improve please."
"i love netflix, but with the raise in cost per month you'd think the selection would be even better. I live in Canada and just recently found out we get half the selection as usa. pretty unfair, in all honesty. we all pay the same amount ao we should have the same selection. also, everytime i try to select a title it says I have to turn off the services and download later. I'm not trying to download anything."
I love Netflix I can watch all my favorites shows but now I can't connect to my TV where I can watch TV with my family I never changed my wi-fi or anything Ive tried everything you could think of to maybe help but nothing did so now I can't enjoy a show on my TV if anyone can help I'm accepting anything
"Google will remove my review if I go under 3*.. Amazing. Cancelled my subscription because Netflix refuses to allow me to watch in HD on my phone due to some nonsensical streaming DRM called Widevine. I purchased my phone legally, I pay for Netflix with my own credit card, but I'm getting hit with DRM that only lets me watch Netflix in standard definition?! Nah, I think I'll just cancel my almost 10 year long subscription. YouTube/Disney+/Hulu/etc. let me stream in HD, I'll pay for those."
"You guys seem be having some technical difficulties when it comes to playing movies on Smart TVs when using mobile hotspot.. Everything is checked with the network, and recently when I've been wanting to watch any movie at all, it comes up saying ""We're having trouble playing this title right now. Please try again later or select a different title."" And it has done this since lastnight. So if this could please be looked into then resolved, it'd be much appreciated."
"Great app! Been having problems with my downloaded videos on my mobile phone though. This happened to all my saved episodes on different days/ different downloading dates. It says I've succeasfully downloaded and saved them for offline viewing. However, they won't play with or without internet. Please fix this. Working in a place without internet or strong signal for data, and would really like to watch my shows during breaktime. Thank you! Hoping to hear from you soon."
"After half year I must say I have nothing to watch. I would watch some old movies but they been removed from library. Tracking new titles is difficult because there is no chronological list of titles. Netflix is all the time trying to make me to watch something I don't like to watch. I definitely don't like that titles are removed after time, and I don't like that some titles are not available in my location. If that is because of privacy law, I say that should be illegal as it's discrimination."
"Good platform. Why 3 stars then? Because: NO James Bond, LOTR, Hobbit, Matrix, Avatar, Bourne, etc. Simply put, search 20 movies off the top of your head and you will only find 2, due to licensing. I waited a year to review because I wanted to see if the big titles will be brought in but they haven't. If you are looking for entertainment and don't mind choosing from what they offer (and they do offer a lot), it's great. But if you want specific titles you probably will be disappointed."
"First, netflix's account sharing is awesome. Up to five people can use one account. The biggest problem however is the lack of user control on video quality. Whether on mobile or pc, I cannot lock the video quality to HD when streaming. It fluctuates along with the internet speed. I know I can always download, but come on, that takes up space on my phone or PC."
"Used to be great until the last update. The cast icon covers buttons on the remote, which would be problematic, but the remote functionality is a HUGE POS now. Rarely works, constantly disconnects, the service forgets where I am on the episode when I use the cast vs the device. I have a show playing right now, and the only reason I'm writing this vs watching is because I switched from cast to device while I was in the other room, came back and pushed to the TV again, and I'm 20m behind (ggrrr) and I can't cast forward to where I was on my phone (GAH!). Service is great, app devs are far from questionable."
"Every time I find an interesting movie online or on social media, or I hear other people talk about this amazing movie they watch, I try to find It on Netflix as this is the streaming service I use. Everything I search up is not on Netflix. It's really annoying as it's happened more than a few times but dozens of times. I've been with Netflix for years, but I may start searching for other streaming services if Netflix doesn't start adding better eye-catching and interesting movies."
"Normally, an amazing app. The show/movie selection is awesome, and the Netflix originals are always good. However, it's been refusing to connect to my Chrome Cast and I'm having to uninstall and reinstall the app every time just so it will acknowledge that casting is even a function. If they're able to correct the bug, then I'd be more than happy to give them full stars."
"Netflix, please sort your app to work in split screen on tablets. I'm on the 2018 iPad pro and just spent the last hour trying to split screen, thinking it was a problem with my ipad. Then when I discovered it was the app I tried watching Netflix from the website and it forces me back to the app. I like to watch shows as I work, so this is a massive disappointment."
"The app seems to have become rather disappointing on my Yoga Tab 3 tablet lately. Queuing downloads seems to trigger a wave of freezing and ""Not Responding"" messages when trying to play shows, which indicates that the app can't seem to handle different threads very well any more. I know my tablet is up to the task as other apps handle this sort of thing without issue."
"Netflix is a great service and it's getting better. I'd be encouraged to give Netflix a 5 star rating but the app itself needs some serious work. The ""my list"" section doesn't load so I honestly have no idea what's on my watchlist and I can't manage it. It doesn't work from the ""more"" section either. Hasn't for a while. Also I think the way the app is navigated could use some refinement. There's so much thrown at you it can be hard to find what you want over what's there."
"Netflix definitely has it's perrks, but that's mostly to twenty somethings -maybe early 3at best. Older films, especially 70's & 80's ones, are rare & difficult to find. On the other hand, loads of typical, big budget movies are easy to find. Just not too impressed with Netflix, there's much room for improvement, in my opinion."
"The app use to be fine, though latest update causes all English movies and series to skip a few minutes or keeps buffing for a long while. Oddly enough, the app gives no problems when I watch Korean movies or dramas, I haven't tested other movies/series in other languages besides English and Korean. I hope that this issue will be resolved with the next update."
"IMPORTANT INFO!!! It's hard to subscribe for a whole app only to find the content that we don't like. It's better to pay for movies of our choice in the app than the subscription thing. Remember all these movies we can easily access them elsewhere free. Last 2 stars are for History on the movies one has watched. Bring up something like, ""mark as watched."" Then again, another feature is to save movies categorically, as in for playlists. 3rdly, read customers' reviews and adjust a accordingly."
"Having issues with the darkness. My screen is as bright as I can get it and I can't see much. Even in the daytime parts of episodes. Subtitles won't shut off anymore as in they turn on after every episode o watch. After turning them off. If you're reading this and say something like well get a better phone, (GoT. Reference). Negative, anything else I watch has no issues with the brightness."
"I've always like Netflix. They typically offer great shows, but there are some times when I can't find anything to watch. I'd give 5 stars, if not for this issue: it always wants to cast to my tv! Like, no, I do not want my tv's to start playing the Netflix that I am watching on my tablet. I'm always worried that I'll click on it, then have to get up to go turn off my tv."
"Well, firstly it keeps recommending movies I've already watched...on the app. And secondly 5/10 times I've downloaded stuff the audio and video is out of sync when I use Wifi direct to watch from my phone on my TV. Switched off my phone and TV. Restarted both...5/10 times it works. The other 5/10 times it's still out of sync. Like watching a bad 80's dubbed kungfu movie."
"I really love this app and having the ability to watch things on my phone, but it is infernally frustrating to be watching a series and every time I close the app, or have an episode paused long enough for the app time out and go back to the home screen, it doesn't start me back at the same spot i ended. It's always jumping back an episode or two and i have to hunt for where i actually left off. Will bump up to 5 stars once this is fixed."
"The UI of the app has gotten a lot worse over time, which is nothing everyone isn't already saying. Another problem I have with the app is that it gives me so many problems when trying to connect to my Chromecast from my phone. Every single time I open the app and press the cast button from the main screen, it doesn't find my Chromecast. I have to force quit and reopen for it to connect, then when I play something it still plays on my phone. I force quit 3+ times usually before it works."
I only use the app to find shows to stream on my TV and for that it is very good. The layout of shows is good. Problem I have it would nice to be able to hide or remove shows I no longer want so looking through the shows I haven't seen is easier. Also sometimes you start watching a show but it isn't something you like but it stays in the continue watching and needs to be removed.
"I love Netflix but im starting to have an issue with the fact that now, subtitles are on automatically. if I want subtitles I am more than capable of turning them on myself thank you please turn this feature off ASAP I do not like reading everything being said on the TV! Especially when in over 90% of the shows that I have seen there are words and even full phrases missing in the subtitles"
"Handy app but lately, just firing something on chromecast drains the battery in no time, about 1%per minute - never used to do so! Also would like a way to clear shows I've started watching but didn't like instead of having them staying on my 'continue to watch list' and it's like recommendations for series and films to be separate."
"Not much changes. Suggestions don't change either, just the pictures of the same movies change. I wish there was a way to omit gore and jump scares from suggestions, my recommended watches always have it and I like neither. Would love to see more series that don't involve relentless suffering stick around for more than 1 season at most."
This app would be great... If you'd fix how the subtitles work on android. I turned them on once to see what one of the people said and now I have to turn them off every eposide now. This happened previously and all I did was set my subtitles to off then signed out and back in and it fixed it. Did it three times this time and it didn't work. I don't need distracting subtitles and CC when what I'm watching is already in English. Fix this. It's annoying!
I loved this app for a long time. today it froze on opening. I did an update which didn't work. I then deleted the app and tried to reinstall it. same thing happened. again I deleted it. now I have the Netflix logo stuck at the top left of my phone beside my connection icon. I've turned my phone off to try and get rid of it several times and it remains there.
"Netflix is an alright streaming app. You pay for the subscription monthly, but they have now taken out the feature where you can share you're login with other people. So now I cannot have my daughter use it on her own device here, which really sucks considering I had been paying for the Premium version. But aside from that I do enjoy the selection of shows I can watch."
"Edit 2022-08-26: Netflix has really gone downhill on some things. Stop randomizing ""my list"". Just leave things in the order I added them! Tons of descriptions now only mention people involved in production, not what the show/film is about. The indicator for new ""short laughs"" is annoying; I don't care about those clips or Netflix games ‚Äî they're just cluttering up the page. Netflix still wins in content diversity but Disney+ has long beaten them in terms of overall user experience/UI details."
I am facing a problem while watching show video is getting stuck in between.
"PLEASE! Add the ""Skip Intro"" pop-up button to the notification/playback panel. üôèü§ùüëå And if you wanna make it even better. Add a permission to use the mic to only turn on for a set amount of time(seconds) when the ""Are You Still There?"" pop-up shows, so we can have the option to say ""yes"" or ""no"" to continue playing. (Always losing remote lol.)"
Ever since I updated the app it freezes a lot and kicks me off the site whilst I'm watching a movie. When I've finished watching a movie or series it goes back to the beginning and stay on my continue watching section. Some days one or two movies will disappear from my continue watching list but then a few hours later it will return which is really annoying I'm so close to giving up on Netflix
"I had the audio only option for a bit and loved it. It appears that was a beta feature. Please roll it out for real. I almost exclusively listen to shows/movies on my phone and it was a godsend when this feature was available--a little box didn't cover my other apps, I could completely turn off my display and not chew through my battery...so many reasons to love it. Without that option, the app is just meh."
"It was good for awhile, but now it seems like it is full of foreign movies! If something doesn't change really soon I will be cancelling my subscription. My husband was watching a couple of movies over and over again and they removed them. We have been with Netflix for many years, and The Karate Kid has been on their since we started with Netflix and it's still on Netflix...."
"I love Netflix but since the last two updates it only makes the app messy. It plays okay at the first few minutes then the video will stop but the audio processed, I tried to exit the video then enter agin but it still the same, it plays the audio but the video is still not moving, then I tried to uninstall the app but nothing change, well i think it only made the app worst..."
"New my list feature is a good idea and definitely has potential. But here's what I noticed is very annoying: 1.) They don't seem to have any type of order whatsoever. Not most recently added or alphabetical. 2.) I will tap on a movie to get the description, change my mind, hit the back button and all of a sudden I'm back at the very beginning of My List which has over 100 titles added. This is the most annoying and inconvenient experience I've had with Netflix and so I took a star off for that."
"It's perfectly fine with just normal watching, but can often be frustrating to use due to odd quirks and glitches. It's also at times annoying to navigate or find a specific thing because it loves to show just recommended or curated lists. It labels episodes you've already watched as new episodes at times. The trailers for things constantly try to play on the info page, and if you're connected to a TV, when done will relaunch the show at the beginning, even if you're already watching it."
Netflix no joke is a great streaming platform for movie and entertainment. But it does lack the feature that can enable we the subscribers to give a comment and express our view on any show we watch
"This a very good app where you get the latest movies and interesting tv shows. But the monthly pricing is way too high as compared to other streaming apps (like Amazon Prime, Hotstar). Atleast at this time of the Corona outbreak, as people are staying at home and are locked down, Netflix should have provided discounted rates. Many such online services have given discount or some accesses free for sometime till this situation is under control."
"Overall i love Netflix, but on my galaxy note 10+ (from VzW), this app is bloatware. Meaning it comes preinstalled on the device, and the only option that you have is to disable the app, uninstalling it completely is not available (Rooting is not an option since it is illegal in the US, and voids warranty). I dont really think this is all netflix fault, nor do i blame samsung, at least for this app, partly since it was downloaded via the google play store and not the galaxy store."
"app usually works pretty well but for the past few days in a row it won't let me watch anything. literally anything. I keep getting the same notification (this title isn't available to watch immediately, choose another title) for literally anything I click. On the website it says this is an app problem (works fine online) but it's been occurring for days???"
"I enjoy the content of this service, but the app is just too inconsistent. The app randomly decides to record your progress through some episodes/movies, but refuses to do so for others. Switching back over to the app after momentarily checking something in another app sometimes restarts an episode/movie. Sometimes the pop-out video player works, other times the UI just freezes and you can't play the content you were watching. TL;DR: Content is great, user experience is pretty shoddy."
"Netflix is great! It's easy and simple to use, amazing shows/movies, and honestly just a nice app. The one thing that has been really putting a dent in my experience is the fact that I can't take anything off of my list. It might not be the biggest deal, but for the weirdos like me who enjoy organization, it's a bit of a nightmare. Please fix it! Thank you."
"This app is so bad. If i switch to another app, this app immediately become mini player that really annoys me. And if i close the miniplayer, this app hasn't synced to netflix server and my progress was lost. For example, i've watched a tv series until eps 7, then something came up and i closed the miniplayer. When i open netflix again, it started from eps 6."
"The inability to send feedback about the app is annoying and shows a lack concern for the user. As there are many usability issues, this is unfortunate. For example, if you're not sharing a subscription, even so it will constantly ask you upon opening the app who's watching! I think this was meant as a discoverability feature, but the ""tutorial phase"" never ends."
"Very good app. However, I would recommend adding a category for shows and movies that are scheduled for removal in the next month. It would really beat going through my entire list every month to see when my favourite shows are scheduled for removal, or meeting them gone without warning as I was planning to watch/ rewatch them."
"App is overall pretty good . However there are a few defects. For example, sometimes when you're watching a video you'll just skip to a different episode even if you haven't pressed anything. Also, if you're on a flaky internet connection, it won't just buffer and wait for the video to load. Instead, sometimes it'll just skip parts of the video. Would also be nice if you could allow people to view videos in portrait mode."
"The app/site is okay, I just wish there was a larger variety to choose from or at leastthe full series of a show. Take for example my little sister wanted to watch HSM but all you guys had was HSM3, I wanted to ""finish"" Bleach and you guys only have to season 3, and so in and so forth. Also the app just freezes from time to time and I have to force shut my phone off to get everything working again."
"I really enjoy watching Netflix but since the new update there is a feature where your device brightness and the app brightness are not paired anymore. This is extremely annoying especially when you where first watching in a darker environment and then later try to watch in a lighter environment, it is almost impossible to adjust the brightness to a suitable level. So please Netflix have an option to turn this off."
"I'm having issues with the app after I updated it. It keeps deleting the episode that I already downloaded on my phone and if I tried to download them again it's not allowing me anymore keeps getting an error msg. I already refresh my phone, uninstall the app and then install it again but it's doing the same thing. So frustrating that I am paying my bill every month but can't use it properly"
"They are relying heavily on their original shows more than anything else and have neglected to add anything new I'd watch, either because it's very low-quality, I've seen it before, or I already own it on DVD/Blu-ray. On Netflix you'll get cheesy Hallmark-esque ""inspirational"" movies, b-horror with terrible ratings anywhere you look, a scant number of blockbusters from the 80s and 90s, anime, and the newer Disney movies, which I already buy. If your movie interests are gorgeous classics, Bergman, Fellini, 4+ star horror, Studio Ghibli, stunning foreign films, hard-to-find shows and movies, etc., this subscription may not be for you. I gave this app three stars instead of two because I did see The Void a few months ago and really liked it. However, I can't seriously recommend Netflix either way. I hope someday they create a new subscription for people who only want to pay to see their original series."
"After 5 years with Netflix I give up. Technically is ok, never let me down but I catch myself spending lots of time looking for movie to watch, why? Because you change movie cover for the same movie again and again. This is horrible. Unfortunately you sent me messages about prices you are increes and I change Netflix for different operator, cheaper, more to watch, more languages to choose and the same cover always!"
"Inferface is good compared to other streaming apps. However, I do experience this bug that cuts all menu content from subtitles to settings whenever my screen locks while in a landscape orientation. To temporarily fix the problem, I go back to the episode list and open the episode again. It gets annoying however as it takes longer to resume a show."
"The functionality is great when watching my shows or movies, but I have a few problems. First, I hate when it starts playing the trailer for the show when I'm just scrolling through. I have to rush through searching just so the trailer for something I don't care about won't start blasting. Also, 9 times out of 10, the show or movie I want to watch isn't available. Bakugan, Ben 10, Teen Titans (The OG series), Teen Titans: The Judas Contract, the Paranormal Activity (movie) series, and Steven Universe are all examples of shows or movies I want to watch on Netflix, but can't. And when I DO find a show I want to watch, about half of the time, the full series isn't on. I wanted to watch Adam Ruins Everything, but out of 3 seasons, only season 1 is available. When you can find something good to watch, it is enjoyable, but the challenge is finding something good to watch."
"Netflix may be the first streaming platform, May have done pretty good movies and great original series, BUT... For some odd reason it usually buffers for so long or kicks me out that I almost always just wind up watching something else on another streaming platform. I've contacted them and they always tell me it's my tv - but i don't believe that as all my other apps work just fine... I'm thinking of canceling my subscription."
Can't open the app no matter what I try. I keep getting a device error message on my Samsung Galaxy A52. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling but nothing works.
"Netflix is alright, it does have a good supply of TV shows and movies but there are some irritating thing that Netflixs has done. Firstly it takes TV shows and movies out with no warning, which is annoying, you could be half way through a show and then suddenly it's not there anymore. Secondly it has problems when it comes to downloading, it either doesn't want to download certain episodes or not download at all."
"Overall this app is wonderful and convenient but the selection of shows and movies are very unpredictable. For starters for some anime shows they don't have all the seasons. Secondly, they don't have the best selection of shows and movies. I really can't find anything that intrests me. If netflix were able to add more of a quantity or selection of shows and movies they would be a lot better as a whole."
"It's cool. Got a Lotta ü§´ with it playing blankly in the background. But they don't let you know easily whether a movie is foreign, voice over, or subtitle only. Russian, French, Asian. They're not bad movies at all, however sometimes I'd like to know without speeding ten minutes in to hear a conversation than rewinding. Kind of a hassle for something that mostly plays in the back ground. Over all I say get it. I've had it for years and will continue for years more."
I think Netflix is an great app! But it's really really annoying when I barely touch the edge of the screen with the side of my finger on accident then it exits the video. I'd give it 5 stars if there was a feature like a button that allows you to lock the screen so nothing happens if you accidentally touch it or anything.
"I often listen to movies and shows in the background, more than I actually ""watch"" them. I should be able to filter for preferred audio languages (including yes/no to dubbed content). It doesn't even LIST country of origin and language in the info! Also, things I watched (on or off Netflix) belong ONLY in ""watched"" or ""watch again"" lists. Why would things I finished watching last week still show up in multiple lists, such as ""recommended for you"", ""Trending"", etc.?"
"I mainly use this app on a TCL tablet and it works just fine except when the ""eye comfort"" setting is engaged, then it turns back into the black screen with only audio. Just like before, previews work fine but actually trying to watch anything the picture disappears. Also, I genuinely hate that if I'm scrolling through shows and I don't keep moving a preview starts. I know this is nice for some but I'll actively avoid looking at things for too long so I don't trigger the automatic preview."
"Personally, netflix is a great entertainment platform, but it depends on the content you enjoy. Netflix shows quite a variety of modern entertainment but very little classics. I am more into the modern content so I'm fine in this situation. But If you're into the old movies and series netflix is not the platform for you. I will continue to use this application , because I enjoy the content."
"Okay, let's start off by saying that, for the most part, the app is excellent. However, to help with those boring flights and get over those obscure TV stations at your destination you could always download a few movies, etc. Ah, but hold on, you need to go on-line and validate the downloads - at which point you get a notice saying your downloads are not licenced for your region. At this point your downloads were pointless. Let my account travel with me - please!"
"I've experienced having to uninstall and reinstall Netflix twice because it kept crashing. First time i installed it, it was working fine and after a few days i tried going into the app but it kept telling me there was an error. I tried restarting my phone as suggested but nothing changed so i had to uninstall and reinstall the app. Help please"
"Hi Netflix. I'm a loyal customer, me and my family are. Ive recently bought a 2022, 70"" LG tv. After downloading some streaming Apps. I noticed that only the Netflix one has a blurry interface when the rest are looking sharp. Ive done all the checks, unplugged the TV, reset the router/network but the interface still look low quality. Nothing wrong with the content though, videos are rendering at good quality.. do you know why that is ? Is it a compatibility issue with LG ?"
So then streaming shows from Netflix onto the big screen is okay but Netflix will not allow the playback speed controls from the app to be Chromecast with what you're streaming but I do have an app I downloaded that allows me to use and adjust speed during playback what I am streaming from other apps so that's an easy workaround when Netflix is being so stubborn. You better catch up Netflix with the competition. I can stream any show now available on Netflix with playback speed control.
"You don't really respect the requests for movies submitted by clients, one of them being me. I applied a lot with old but classic movies or newer movies. I'm still waiting for one of these movies like Deep Rising, Underworld: Blood War, etc. I understand that you have many customers but as well as you expect the monthly payment of the subscription even if it is optional and I can give up at any time but I still have to pay to watch so I am waiting for the proposed movies to be put on Netflix."
I think netflix is a great app and i have been using it for year. But it would be nice if we could see our watch history or films that we have rated the same way the can go and see 'my list'. I think it would be quite beneficial if there was more ways to organize your shows this way. To be able to make folders and to have a history of what youve already seen.
"This app is usually great to watch show's on. Although I can still watch the shows I'm interested in, the app does not always allow me to do that easily. It has been glitching on my phone and TV lately. When starting an episode or switching from one, the app freezes and then closes, taking me back to my home screen on either device I'm using."
"I love Netflix. But one particular problem ruins my experience a little. Whenever I fast forward or rewind, the screen with the time bar and the 10 second reverse/fast forward buttons and the pause button come up. Normally you would be able to tap the screen and it would all go away. Now whenever that screen comes up, I have to wait about 30 seconds for it to go away. It got really annoying and I browsed the settings, closed and reopened the app, and even uninstalled the app to fix it but no"
"I think most of the problems that people are experiencing are mostly on their devices and network. The only thing I've realise on Netflix is that it doesn't have a lot of things, I've been told that on Netflix I'll watch anything I want, and now I'm using Netflix about a month now, I've been searching all movies and series that I know but I haven't find any here. Everything I desired to watch are not here, if there's another way of how to search or to find please help, otherwise bye Netflix"
"Games letting my nextlfix experience down. I don't want to see games, (can I switch this off?) So many recommendations that I'm not interested in. Surely netflix can see I'm not interested in gaming!"
"App is not designed for customers. You cannot close the app in Androids app drawer just by closing the app. You have to go into settings and force close to get it out of the notification bar. Once you're in the app, your own list of saved titles is hidden behind layers of non-obvious menus while there is random sections that may or may not be interesting. Even the section to continue watching the season you were in the middle of is randomly buried or may not even show up."
"With the update 13/4/20, things are much nicer and appear fully operational. It would be fantastic to actually see a full list of what is available rather than an automation selecting for you 'based on your viewing history or what others are watching'. Bollocks to that - I would like to see what *I* want to see, not what may be popular. I don't give a damn about Locke and Chain, but I do want to see all the episodes of TeenTitansGo rather than what is geo-fenced."
"I love netflix dont get me wrong but the fact that you cant take something off your continue watching list without fast forwarding it all the way to the end is ludacris. They briefly added that feature and then snatched it out from under us. Its a waist of time having to FF to the end of a movie if you dont like it, just to get it off your list and out of the way. Honestly in this day and age the platform should be more up to date. Thats the only reason for 3 stars. Fix it please!!!"
"The app is better than many video apps with it mostly working as it should, but I do have a couple of issues. The first is that the app overrides your phone's brightness settings which I find to be annoying because I have to control two brightness sliders, so I would appreciate it we could turn it off in the settings. Second is that the video sometimes doesn't stream at 1080p even though I have enough bandwidth, so it would also be good if we had the option to lock the resolution to Full HD."
Would rate it 5 once the Who's watching screen is not required to be selected everytime and would have it selected at device level and can over ride later.
"When it works, it works amazingly well. The picture quality is amazing, the selection is admirable, and the subtitles are getting better. However, for whatever reason, when I try to watch Supernatural or NCIS, for instance, I get kicked out of the app. This happens sporadically; no specific time of day or day of the week. Why is it so hard to get an app you or your significant other pays for to work as desired? To parphrase Lucille Ball's TV husband, ""Netflixxxxx, you got some 'splanin to do!"""
"pretty slow on the new seasons of shows... needs more recent selection like the movies going to Neon, etc. The other annoying thing is that the controls from the pull-down screen and lock screen always disappear.. which is ridiculously counterproductive.. aaaand the little ""10mb"" updates require you to delete far more (eg. 150mb) which is impossible if you have limited space."
"Don't get me wrong , I love Netflix. But this app is a huge battery hog. Had my phone at 100% when I went to bed to wake up with the phone at 60%. The culprit was Netflix. The app wasn't even open or being used. It was just running in the background. Checked the settings in the app, and couldn't find anything I could disable to keep it from doing so. Maybe I'll reinstall it in the future, but not until this is fixed. Also, I miss the star ratings. Now I'm clicking on any old garbage because those star ratings are no longer there to warn me away from the awful shows."
"It's THE streaming service...by default. You think of the word ""streaming"" and your mind automatically goes to ""Netflix."" BUT. The suggestions for things is off. I know theyre pushing their newest and what they perceive to be the best, but if thats the case then what's the point of having the thumbs up and thumbs down as voting? The quality lately has been distorted or low quality. They say its because of my internet, but my internet is fantastic and it's only been acting this way recently."
"Can you please add vertical view option??? It's frustrating that I don't want to use landscape mode sometimes and I don't have the other option available. Also, double tap to skip is fine but I prefer swipe and drag option with timecode a lot more. Many players have that option and it's an absolute pleasure to skip to the part you want."
"Its a good app but it could do with either a menu option to find leaving soon content or a section for that, like they do for added content"
3stars cuz Netflix doesn't have the movie i like or anime i like i had no choice but to use other apps to watch something i like sometimes
"It was great but suddenly when i try to open netflix, it shows a blackscreen and then kicks me out. So i only use it on my tv"
"i watch avatar episode 1 in right resolutions in my handphone, but in next episodes i watch in bad resolution, why can't change resolution manually if watching in netflix phone? i still annoying see pressing image to watch this series"
"Lately when I select the ‚ûï, attempting to add a selection to My List, after the icon changes to the ‚úîÔ∏è, it immediately changes back to the ‚ûï and a pop up note states, ""Error Adding To List"". The result is that I have been unable to add anything to My List for a couple of weeks now. Please review your code and fix so that I can resume loving my Netflix experience."
Netflix don't have best and trending movies like game of thrones I would like changes to be mad as soon as possible and add those demanding movies immediately or Netflix losses it's taste
everytime i download a series and leave the app and when i get back to the app the app pauses .
"An otherwise excellent app now includes a frustrating separate on-screen brightness control feature. It overrides phone brightness, often blinding you at night when you first open the app. It blocks my home button resulting in accidental brightness changes. If you open the pop out player, you're unable to adjust screen brightness without reopening the app and adjusting brightness through the app. It's unclear what problem is even attempted to be solved with the feature."
"it has good shows but the fact that right when i go out of my house, i can't watch anything because of the stupid password sharing rule, well guess what. SCREW YOU NETFLIX"
"I don't understand how your company is just continuing to cancel shows when ppl like them! I'm literally disgusted in this..imperfects was a great show to watch . Every chance you get you cancel something else. Screw your ratings. There are ppl that really actually like alot of series on here that your just like yea, screw it. Cancel it.. your network is a joke.. and so is abc!"
"Netflix definitely a good platform for movies and stuffs but It's always dimming out, and to be able to see the video again, you need to exit the video and wait for refresh before clicking back. Sometimes it doesn't work out, sometimes it does. Kinda annoying. Even when i update the app, it doesn't fixed it. Hope this should be fixed soon. Thank you üòä"
"I would give this five stars but on the Mobile version, it never saves when I stopped/started watching a series or movie. It works perfectly fine on my PlayStation, but for some reason I can't get it to play from when I stopped watching. It's especially bad when I check different apps and go back to watching Netflix, it replays an episode or starts a movie over again. If I start watching Netflix and switch to my PlayStation, it doesn't even register that I switched viewing platforms."
I think the app is amazing!! but!!! I had to delete it and I recently redownloaded it and it keeps giving me a error code and closes out. I've done everything possible to get it to work even deleted again and redownloaded to see if that would work and it keeps giving the same error code. if it would work id get a 5 star rating. im so disappointed i cant binge watch netflix üòîüòîüòî
"Your application onResume makes 3 button navigation invisible, is super annoying has been this way for months get a QA device with 3 button nav"
"I'm giving Netflix a second try with a free trial offer. As soon as I log on,on my phone nothing will load up so I can't browse through unless I search. when I do search I find that they haven't added series or episodes to things that were there 4 years ago last time I had it. Doesn't give me much incentive to keep a subscription."
"I'm rating it 3 stars because, it's a good app for streaming movies/series, has a good number of movies, but majority of recent movies aren't there, same thing with some series, another thing I've noticed is my downloads tab disappeared, I don't know why, please resolve it, if it's an issue, and I don't know why if your subscription finishes, the movie you downloaded will no longer be available?? Please do something about it."
"While the app itself works fine, somehow, after a few hours of watching through the app, it manages to stuff up my tablet's cache to an extent that causes network connection errors that break many other apps, so far the only way to reverse the problem has been to uninstall this app and then clear my cache in recovery mode. Not sure if it's a problem with this specific model as it's a bit of an oldie (Samsung Galaxy S2), but it certainly needs to be fixed."
"Missing on screen volume controls like the iOS version. Also, where are the sinterklaas movies? After update: horizontal scrolling in the episodes section of a series is un-natural to me. On a tablet with one hand it is a pain. I've seen this with other apps. Very annoying. Otherwise very good app. Hardly any problem. The chromecast connection sync could be quicker sometimes. I line the fact we are given more control. For me an advanced profile with much more settings would be great."
"Really great and love the app!! But I have a few issues, 1: most shows you put don't have all the seasons which I dont really get why? 2: when I wanna rewind just A FEW SECONDS back, it's 10 seconds even though I just want to rewind a little clip. 3: Not all shows are available on Netflix which I also dont get? So try to fix it please!"
"I hate that I'm giving this 3 stars coz netflix has been good to me. However, your recent update has a very annoying bug. When a movie is playing, some parts of the movie keeps skipping by some seconds and cutting off. It's really annoying especially when I'm watching an important and interesting part and it just skips and i end up not knowing what was said and rewinding it doesn't fix it. Secondly sometimes the movie just hangs and the audio keeps on playing in the background. Please Fix it."
"Netflix has a wonderful selection of older classic movie, TV's as best shows and series past and current. Independantes as well as Netflix originals. Comedies, drama, horror/syfi, documentaries. They strive to bring you the best of best as selected by viewers. However they do not bring you many of the newer and older movies that were well reviewed by the viwers. And when and if they do you have pay above your subscription. It really makes it hard to justify paying that monthly."
"Im honestly frustrated with Netflix. if you are going to provide a movie that has a sequel or multiple parts, then you need to provide all parts and not just the first or just the second and so on. movies like insidious and the conjuring do not have all of the parts on Netflix. this is annoying when you watch the first one and you see the storyline and get cut off because the second one is not on Netflix. but the 3rd one is. honestly where is the common sense."
"Seriously, why does the platform offer me films/tv shows if I've already watched them? There is no ''mark already watched '' or something like that. That's so annoying. Besides, it's so difficult to find something good yo watch, the quality of films are getting worse. Favorite shows are being canceled. I have deleted the app, and canceled the subscription."
"Yeah it's good in parts. But alot of slow response from app lately. Loading pages for instance! It needs regular refresh for new movies. And I would like the movies in a bundle if there is parts 2/3 etcetera. Lots of series but currently I only watch 2 of them, and guess which ones are the most popular! Please keep the prices down. This my only luxury."
"This app used to be excellent, 5 stars. However after a recent update the widget doesn't update, meaning that you end up restarting what you were watching from the same place repeatedly and have to skip to where you stopped watching. However the worse feature is that while the app is open, it will randomly start playing what you are watching while you're using another app, even if you lock the phone."
"I love watching without commercials and the selection is pretty good. Yet the price keeps going up and up. I am not getting anything more for my money. I still need Hulu and/or Amazon Prime, etc to fill in the blanks. So it has some good shows and movies but I am easily switching as soon as Disney starts up for less. Stop raising prices."
"I'm currently having trouble with the app. It restarts my phone after every episode or movie and is unpredictable when it will do it. I have a galaxy s7. This is the only video app that does this on my phone. It's extremely aggravating. I'll go to watch something and it freezes and restarts. Or I'll be watching something and as soon as the next episode goes to play, it restarts. Then I have to wait for my phone to reload and try to watch it again. Please fix this!"
"I've had this app for a very very long time, but I've noticed in the last year, there are more movies on Netflix in foreign Languages, than there are in the American language, being English. That is becoming extremely annoying, especially when you have to start the movie and play it and wait for them to talk before you can find out what language they are going to talk in. If it's an app being shown in America, why are there so many more foreign movies? Please stop showing so many foreign movies"
"Quality, controls, and selections are great however (as someone with hearing difficulties) when watching international shows or movies the captions are removed when they speak English, I understand many people use captions for the translation but I need them to hear and there have been many instances where I cannot follow the scene because of the English that I can't hear in the absence of constant captions, I've only ever seen this problem in international shows and movies."
"a few complaints all of which I have contacted support about and they are out of ideas how to fix them 1. subtitles- I have to manuelly turn them off at the beginning of each movies or episode 2 crashing during watching a movie/episode sometimes back to main menu, or just logs out completly and sometimes the app itself crashes. a few praises i enjoy your personally produced movies and shows. would like to see more sci-fi and mystery."
"The app is super awesome,it's got like millions of movies and series all put together, and with the introduction of free plan it got even better but there's just one problem though,some of the series'and movies are missing like for instance Under the dome alongside others . I've tried searching for this series but it's not available on Netflix dude fix your app"
All awesome but the problem is most of the popular movies are not available on Netflix üôÇ
"The app is good. I have been using it for years. Generally dependable. But.. Guys, you seriously need to update your search and organization functions. I OFTEN find it difficult to find a movie or show that I KNOW is on Netflix. It is becoming wver more tiresome. Amazon has a much better handle on this, though theirs isnt oprimized either. Put some time and energy into this please. I guarentee who ever gets this figured out will increase their customer loyalty and satisfaction greatly."
It's a wonderful streaming app but on mobile it doesn't work at which it very frustrating so please fix this
"I like the shows and amazing things you can watch (like ArcaneüëÄ), but I honestly don't get why whenever Netflix has something new, they removing something else. It confuses me, and it's kind of annoying. Because one night, me and my friends were planning on watching a movie we saw on Netflix, but when I tried to look for it it wasn't there. Basically telling us it was removed. Which I wasn't the happiest about. So you know... You could have at least kept Sharkboy and Lavagirl..."
"App is not smooth, takes internet again and again to load the same things (like the same homepage). Data Saver mode doesn't save data at all, shows play at HD quality and there's no way to lower it. The video player in general is the biggest issue, it's so weird and definitely isn't optimised for all screen sizes. Words/sentences go out of the screen (like episode names, etc.) and double-tapping to go 10 seconds back is totally inaccurate and annoying."
"Obviously Netflix is great, and I use it constantly, but it's kind of buggy on mobile. I have to exit the app and go back in at least once a day because playback stops unexpectedly and won't resume. Often if I look at my current apps Netflix has several playback windows open. More of minor annoyances than anything, but it still detracts from the experience."
"I've loved netflix so much because series and movies makes me happy or at least it's my escape from this world. And this is my first time having this worst issue in years since I had this app. the video freezes but the audio continues. And I can't resolve the concern of videos not playing unless i uninstalls, installs the app. This makes me so frustrated! will edit this review If I had the time."
"The latest update is just awful, I find it so difficult to continue watching my show. The design was clearly business-driven and not user-driven, and I doubt it even went through rigorous usability testing - because who would ever think to look for their shows under a tab called 'explore'. The home page should give me all the information I need and want, but instead they're using it to try to shove their garbage shows down our throats. Just make better content and we'll watch it."
"The app isn't bad, however there are some things that I do have an issue with. For example, when I switch apps whatever show I was watching eventually starts to play in the background but not in a mini view, it just starts playing while I'm using another app. If my volume is down then I don't notice until a good amount of time has elapsed. It's crazy because I shouldn't expect a problem that hasn't been brought up to be addressed but there are updates all the time so it should be fixed"
"This is a very good app because you can enjoy of different tv shows and movies. However, I would start updating the content content to new one. For example, there is a really good movie called ""the Mule"" with Clint Eastwood that I watched in the cinema a long time ago and I wanna watch it again, and I can't watch it in netflix. I'll give a 3 stars just because of the non-updated content."
"The app works smoothly with zero lag. My biggest issue is how dark the app runs on any of my phones, you have a show or movie that has a scene at might, you are hardly able to watch any of it cause you can't see anything. The apps brightness is all the way up along with the phones brightness and phone display setting is on Vivid. It honestly makes the app extremely disappointing to use cause of this issue and I don't know why they haven't put further settings in to correct this issue..."
"Was great, no ads for my shows. Now it decides it wants to show me a trailer for a different show, after I finish am episode of something I have watched before. Also the price just keeps getting higher, and I don't feel like enough content is added for the upcharges being added so often recently. Honestly considering ending my subscription. Fix your stuff. I don't care if you make shows ""in house"" or whatever, if they aren't good stop wasting money on stuff that isn't gonna help your business."
"There is a bug in ""my list"". Everytime it keeps loading after 20 - 25 movies been scrolled, and it isn't showing othe movies in ""my list""."
"This past few days the pause button keep blocking the screen it won't go away, I can't focus watching, I hope you fixed that"
"So I love netflix, it has shows and movies alike that I love. The price might be a reach but its managable if u play your cards right with all your different subscriptions. The main issue I have is, the app wont show on my phone. Ive tried uninstalling and downloading countless times yet nothing has changed. Would rate 5 stars if this got fixed. Yes I have an android."
"Amazing app...however it doesn't have a lot of movies and series especially the latest ones. So I'm forced to watch wats on Netflix and then when I want to watch another program I have to stream from another app e.g showmax... If you could increase the content especially if latest movies, TV shows and series then it would be 4-5 star experience... Some movies that you have here are ancient üòÇ"
"Not many good films, this wont help you catch up when people say, 'oh you haven't seen it! What?!!!' Mostly average movies, some good series but a lot of their contracts limit their content without a VPN. Also can be very slow even when your wifi is good, in my opinion the service is lacking and could do with improvements in towns away from big cities. But it can still be fun and is often home to few great gems which I would ha e never found without!"
I enjoy using this app. Lots of movies and TV programs to choose from. There's something for almost every member of the family. I can see why so many have chosen to lose their cable service and use this for their viewing needs. UPDATE: sorry Netflix but you're almost becoming as bad as rogers. Your content hasn't changed much but your price has increased exponentially. I suppose you figure you have the Monopoly as Rogers does? Hmm?
I couldnt find the cast button in my Netflix App. My smart TV and my phone is connected to same wifi network. I even turned on and off the tv and phone. I unplugged and plugged the modem. But nothing happens. I want to cast it to my TV. I have a mirror sharing tool in my phone but the video quality via casting is far more high than just mirror-sharing. Please help me. I have tried all my options.
"I really enjoy the Netflix network content, and I enjoyed many hours of entertainment and education on the platform. But often I think of movies and series that would make great ideas to include and perhaps should already be part of the selection. About six of my favourite movies are not available including Nell, and Pay It Forward. I would have expected a suggestion/request facility built into the interface, to facilitate crowd sourced feedback, both for the app itself and its content. Thanks."
"Not easy to find what you are looking for, categories tab is last and all categories are mixed up. Only use when you know what you want to watch is available, beforehand. Also, not worth to pay, bad selection of shows and movies. Recommendations are not really personalised. Video quality is good for smartphone users, not bigger screens."
It's not only my problem but it's every one's problem. -there should be an option like it in YouTube .where there is an option through which we can select the resolution of vedio.. and it must be in netflix. In Netflix it feels ok Ike we are playing vedio in 240p which is not worth it..so please we want an option through which we select the resolution .
"I just bought a ROG 6 Batman Edition phone. For a couple of days Netflix worked perfectly. Since yesterday it has started giving Error 1044. I have tried everything, restarting the phone, uninstall and the installing it back....but nothing works out. On the other hand it's working perfectly in my daughter's ipad and my wife's S21 ultra. Please resolve it as soon as possible. Thanks"
"This app is great, but this recent update has been extremely frustrating! It will take FOREVERR to load and I have good connection. Then when it loads it will play a few seconds and then stop and not continue or it will freeze making me have to go out and repeat the grueling process all over again! I have tried uninstalling it, clearing it, everything I can think of and it's not working! Please help! :("
If only they could have a more extensive movie library; if onlyü•π They're doing well so farüôÇ
"Pls reduce cost, Africans love Netflix but it's becoming too expensive remember we use data to stream... Cut the cost please üôèüèø"
"Good experience most of the time, but the app will not always keep good track of where you left off, especially if you exit out of the app without pausing. My main reason for the 3 stars is that it will sometimes have serious stop-and-start stuttering of the video. This isn't due to connection, because the problem persists on downloaded episodes. I'm on a pixel 3, so I shouldn't have a problem with any video player. This may be make it break if this continues."
"On my s21 The downloads become corrupted at some point very often, so far I haven't been able to isolate what is causing this. Also on my Galaxy Note 10 tablet. Netflix crashes as soon as I try to login. Over all Netflix is a great app. it stream's with less buffering than any other streaming service. They have the most functional u i. These two small bugs do hurt the experience especially on the tablet which it won't work at all."
"Netflix used to be my favorite. Since 2023 began, the app has become unreliable. My family enjoys top line internet, but the Netflix app freezes daily from regular use, a clear testament to the company no longer being able to accommodate a reasonable level of customer traffic in known peak hours. This app used to push out quality shows regularly, but they have stopped that as well. This app is quickly becoming obsolete. I am canceling this subscription in favor of better maintained services."
"Pricing, screens, ads, casting, etc. Used to be better."
"Most of the time it's good. But a few things are a shame. Cant turn off the ""are you still watching?"" interruptions and sometimes updates mess things up. Since the last update the ""Apply"" button for subtitles and languages went out of screen (can barely see the border) and no way to click it on Oneplus 9 pro. Often problems that are not a life ruiner, but that also seem quite easy to avoid from development/usability perspective. Ill just wait again for the next update."
"There is still great content here; but app support is an afterthought. Fancy features are added that seem fantastic at first. Download to watch offline, or automatically download suggested viewing as examples. What is not thought out is how all that background activity destroys battery life. If you use this app on a mobile device downloading on wifi can save tons of data. I recommend using the feature. But don't let it do anything automatically! Try forcing the app to stop when not in use."
A great feature was removed from Netflix. The feature where you could remove the movies or series that you left half way. I have many series that I just got bored with and don't wanna watch anymore but I can't remove it. Only way I can remove it is by completing the whole damn thing. It's just annoying to have that there. THE FEATURE IS BACK SO ONE MORE STAR FOR YOU. Why not better? Because alot of great programs are available on Netflix but not in my region.
"The new update is good btw. Particularly in the subtitle issue which is now had black background in it. I gave 3 stars right now because I prefer the old subtitle with just white. Maybe you can add customization setting for the CC appearance Netflix, because I feel it really weird when that black background in the subtitle somehow blocking some of the screen or the scenes. Please fix this!!"
"Netflix is a great and wonderfull app, you download movies and series and keep watching though your offline, the price is fair according to the level u subscribed, but there is a serious matter that has happened all over these times since, iv used netflix for the past 5 years its great but the problem is the message that states( there is a problem playing this video please try again later, more, ok.) Though you delete the app and install again or reset the phone its there always."
"For some time now,the show or movie im watching will stop playing the visual while the audio keeps going. Or it will skip 20-30 seconds and i have no way of reminding to try to go back to the portion i missed. Idk why this is happening, but when it happens 2 or 3 times during one show, its very annoying. Happens at least once every time i watch something."
"Netflix is great in the sense that it streams right away and the algorithyms really help to reconmend new movies that are similar to my preference. What is not great is that it is so limited in options..you cant go search for a movie you have in mind, you only get what is on. A app like popcorn time is better in this sense, but it doesnt offer algorityms or quick streaming. We need the perfect combo"
"The content is great and have no issues with the selection but the experience itself of finding the shows is absolutely horrible. It's always recommending the same shows over and over, in the multiple sections even if I haven't clicked on any of them in months. You guys need to rethink your UI as well as your algorithms. It's unfortunate because I'm convinced people miss out on great content because of it and in return you end up spending money on show and movies most will never get to see."
"3 reasons for a 3 star review. 1.)There's a few originals that are fantastic but, of course, Netflix cancels them after 2 or 3 seasons. That's pretty frustrating. 2.) No picture-in-picture. Which is why I usually use Prime instead for my go-to streaming. 3.) Content vs Price increases vs functionality way off. Pros: Watching Ozark's last season. The end."
"When I first started, Netflix was like $8/month. Now they are going to $23. It's no longer a better deal to cancel cable and stream; cable is cheaper than getting 6 different streaming services. They got rid of a lot of the shows I liked, they didn't bring in anything new I liked, and it's just not worth it to me anymore."
This platform is fine but they cancel shows so often. It's bad TV to watch two seasons and it gets canceled without a real ending to actually satisfy the people who enjoyed the shows.
"Great app but something that annoys me is the fact that I can't remove a video title from ""continue watching"". Surprisingly enough you guys made an option where you could do that but recently I saw it's gone. Put it back please. it's a real annoyance to see a title still there after I have finished watching it and I have to manually go and remove it from my viewing activity all the time."
"I just love netflix...I don't watch free-to-air TV anymore. Huge range of movies, TV series and docco's to suit all tastes. But.....I'll knock two stars off because netflix cuts short the movie when the credits roll at the end of the movie and stick a bloody trailer on. YES !....there are thousands of netflix viewers like me who are interested in the credits and sometimes the great music soundtrack that goes with it ! Please netflix.....let the credits roll !"
"Why do I have to uninstall and re-install the app so often. I'm unable to watch the stuff that I have downloaded. When I uninstall and re-install, everything I downloaded is gone and need to download again. This is not working nicely, wasting my data on this. I'm not very happy!!!! 8 June - still the same problem.... nice Netflix - still no answer on my problem....."
"What happened to this new feature that disables the annoying preview at the title screen? I've made sure it's unchecked several times and each time I'm on my TV, I've got these annoying mothereffing previews playing. For the love of something or other, please turn the previews off! Also, I'm still having issues with playback on my Chromebook. Some shows and/or movies have blurry playback. Some but not all. Everything else is good though. Keep up the ____ work."
"The app has problems. Half the time it doesn't even work anymore and when i do get it to work, if i watch previews for one thing, then it will auto play previews for everything till i reset the app. Netflix is really going downhill with really bad decisions since they have competition now. They need to stop using a ai that only shows titles, the ai thinks i might like."
"I love Netflix, the range of tv shows, movies, cartoons etc..exceptional. would have rated a 5 a few months ago, However recently I have been having issues with shows loading, constantly saying error. I haven't had this issue with any other streaming services, so it's disappointing to be experiencing this all of a sudden with netflix"
"The movies and series are fantastic, but this app has three flaws. The first is that the quality is occasionally grainy, the second is that some of the episodes are incomplete. and the third is that when I try to play the next episode, it simply freezes and loads, despite the fact that there is nothing wrong with my device. Thank you for your time and consideration in resolving these difficulties."
It's a really good app but about 3 or 4 days ago it started gliching and it doesn't play any of my shows it doesn't even open. I deleted it and re-installed but still the same problem. It's really annoying that I always have to delete and re download the app after my wifi goes down because it doesn't play unless I delete and re install
"I've been using this app for a few months now and I haven't experienced any problems besides that subtitles cannot be read sometimes due to the light background and subtitles have the same color and have no black borderline to emphasize the words. As an anime fan who cannot understand Japanese language without translations, I am missing some important details of the story. And it actually spoils the fun and I found it annoying. Please fix this problem asap. So, I'm giving this 3 stars for now."
Smooth transaction to avail the subscription. Plenty of movies and tv series to choose from. My issue however is how subtitles appearance does not apply on my device even though other streaming platforms do not have this issue. I only see white text which looks bad with light or white backgrounds. Hope they fix this.
"The app is alright. It doesn't have lots of movies or series's that i want to watch. Please update new anime like the bnha series or at least have the complete set of one series instead of some seasons of it. It sucks that i cannot finish my shows because not the full set is there. But on the good parts of it, there are a big veriety of movies/series's to try and there are minimal bug or wifi problems. I do like also that i can do stuff without needing some kind of unlimited pack. Thanks."
"Everything is perfectly fine except for the fact that some of my unfinished watched movies gone from the row because I didn't open it for so long and also, everything fine until yesterday when I have to upgrade it and I just finished upgrade it but I can't open it- like it keeps on asking which account I want to use, then I just clicked the one I use but then it suddenly goes out, so I try again but it just repeat the same thing! Please just fix this problem! This just irritated me so much!!"
"Wonderful shows and films, like Stranger Things and TMVSTM. But a really big issue is some time ago video playback changed to SD, which looks absolutely awful. Everything is pixelated and flat, and I kinda stopped watching it. I looked up my problem online, and apparently it's because Netflix won't let Standard Membership users in the UK watch in HD, which is pathetic. If I didn't have this problem I would rate 5 stars."
It's a good app but pls put the series or movies the same time it comes out because it comes out very late
App is good for entertainment need some improvements like make sure all movie should be available
"What's happening Netflix, it won't let me go into my profile anymore. Keeps saying error. Not good when I'm paying to use it and it's not working. Hurry and fix please"
"Unfortunately, the major feaure of this app, playing videos, has a flaw: Netflix takes control of the brightness setting of the screen. This leads me to not being able to set the brightness as dim as I want as the lowest setting is still much higher as the system setting for the screen. The app should just focus on playing videos and leaving control of things like screen brightness to the OS. It's barely useable as is, but still does an ok job, so 3/5."
Please update one piece! I finish already all the episodes you uploaded. Please put all the episodes! Thanks!! Ill change my rate if you upload all the episodes
"Right now I have one major problem with the app. It automatically plays the next suggestion once the end credits is reached, with no way to skip it. Some movies still have content even in the end title, and yet others I would like to hear the end title music sometimes. Please give a provision to skip the autoplay of next suggestion or time it to the actual end of the movie."
"Usually great however as of recently the app keeps disconnecting me from my WiFi. I thought it was just connection issues but this only ever happens when I use Netflix. Please fix this. And lower the prices xx. Can't be this expensive in the cost of living crisis. And to add, the quality drops too a lot. It'll randomly drop from 1080p to 144p. And the option to only chose standard and higher should be changed to selecting more specific specifications such as 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360, 240 and 144p"
"Netflix has a lot to offer, but it used to have a lot more. As other content providers have begun to keep their content for themselves, the quality of Netflix offerings has definitely been diluted. But Netflix's primary shortcoming is that the platform makes it difficult to find worthwhile content. Most of the categories that pop up have no interest to me, & exploring the options that are available is prohibitively challenging. & replacing a star rating system with liked/didn't like is asinine."
The app is mostly good except for the thing that when i pause a movie or episode on nerflix and open another app like facebook and watch a video on it. Then when the vid stops netflix starts playing in the background so i have to close the app to do something. It also sometimes does not resumes from the point where i left so i have to manually adjust it and as you know it only shows remaining minutes it is a headache adjusting it.
I wish it would tell you what language a show is in before you start watching it; I have learned to read the names of the cast to try and decide the language. I don't mind movies with subtitles is if I have the time to just sit and focus without interruptions. Also wouod be nice if their were more movies available on the actual app with out having to order them.
So bad when using with Chromecast. Constantly loses connection and destroys my battery. Even when I've finished watching if I don't properly close the app it continues to destroy my battery and I get system level cpu warnings. Aside from that it's a nice app. Really hope they can fix chromecast integration.
"App is great, one of the best in the game. My issue is with their content. They seem to focus on volume over quality now. They used to be the benchmark in tv show quality, well other than HBO, but now I find 90% of new content is just trash. I find Disney+ to be my new favorite streaming service, even apple tv seems to be releasing better shows. Only reason I haven't cancelled yet, I'm sharing my account with my sis and don't want to cut her off."
I love Netflix but for some reason over the last 2 weeks whenever I try to watch it on my phone the picture stops and freezes while the audio continues on. I have a Sony Xperia 1 only a few months old and Netflix has been working fine since day one. I thought the most recent update would have fixed the issue but it hasn't. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
"It's a great app, there are just a few frustrating things. Being able to go back to the previous screen using the back button in the app and the back button on my phone is an issue sometimes, especially when I'm trying to find other shows/movies using the ""more like this"" tab. Having to go all the way back to the starting point is really frustrating because I'm not always able to remember the title of the show that I'm trying to go back and look at. I've missed out on tons of potential shows because of such a small issue."
It's a good app for watching movies and shows. However there is a couple of things I find to be irritating and that is most of the shows I want to watch don't start from the very beginning of the series. So it's pointless to start watching it half way through the series. And also there is some good looking movies I would love to watch but I can't because its in a different language. I wish there was a feature in the settings that would allow me to turn off the foreign languages movies/shows.
"Ever since the new update I can barely watch any of the shows I love. Friends and that 70s show are two shows that play religiously in this household and now, for some reason its just not loading. Some other shows will work for an episode or two and then also stop. Ive reinstalled the app, restarted my phone both multiple times to no avail. Its not my internet as all my other apps are working just fine. I pay for premium and I expect the app to work as such."
"Could be better. Would be 5 stars if you had the option to select ""watched"" on movies or individual episodes you've already seen so it doesn't keep recommending them. Also, from the keep watching section, it doesn't save the most recent history lately. You'll end up restarting an episode or going back to previous ones because it hasn't updated the cache."
Netflix could you please update the app to be compatible with Samsung Dex it's very popular as becoming even more popular and soon they'll be desktop for every Android device basically. at the moment I can watch YouTube and use my phone at the same time this is because I'm a YouTube red subscriber and all play in the background. I'm sure it's just a very tiny tweak because while I'm texting now Netflix is pause but wants to play so yeah if you could that update that five stars thank you
"I would rate higher but I am having the same issue with the subtitles coming on automatically after disabling them every movie or episode, & when watching episodes in a series, it turns on at the start of each episode. This is a problem! I logged out of all devices, reset my password and it stopped for 1 day, now it's back up again. At first it was a foreign language, at least now it is English but still, it almost makes me not want to use the app. NETFLIX, PLEASE CORRECT THIS ISSUE PROMPTLY."
"Your app keeps misbehaving. The shows are great for sure. But the app keeps crashing on both android and Chrome TV. It's annoying considering that, like everyone else, I'm paying for a service that keeps crashing. Please look into it so that we can all enjoy the service and viewing. Cheers!"
"Netflix is a multimillion dollar app yet, they decide to 1. Increase monthly price. 2. Make the family package more difficult with the new 2 screen rule. Not only does this make road trips, plane rides, etc. More difficult, but you have to pay to get what you had before (4 screens) this has honestly been surprising and I think that its a pretty selfish move. Other than that recent issue netflix is one of my most used apps with great services and shows."
Can't change the brightness. Please fix it
if your looking to cast to your TV this app is the worst choice. I try several times and what works one time doesn't the next almost always have to shut my phone down and start fresh but even that doesn't always work. hulu works first time always less hassle. dissatisfaction with the casting part of the netflix app is a 100% dissatisfaction.
Its a pretty good app to watch movies and all but I really miss some of the movies that ya'll use to have but then took it off and replaced it with some lame little kid shows. Just because a movie isn't watched to often doesn't mean people don't love watching it. Ya'll use to have a lot more good movies from a variety of different contents but know there's not too many things I like to watch and know there's mostly just little kid shows. Miss old Netflix when I was a little kid it was way better
"When on my phone it keep freezing up but volume, sound still plays and I have a new phone sssssooooooo yyeeeaah"
"I really dislike that you can not turn off auto previews completely. I no longer go to read descriptions of movies or shows because of the auto previews. Which means, if I don't already know about it, or the picture doesn't look Interesting, I skip it. Also sucks that the descriptions that are on the home page are about whatever actor are in it or the director, and not the actual product."
"The app is good. The user-interface friendly to use - something that Amazon Prime needs working on. Netflix content is ok, but their in-house productions are weak in terms of storyline and very rarely come out with a gem. Netflix needs to take a leaf out of Amazon Prime's book by expanding into other arenas such as classic and arthouse films, concerts, etc - even if it means charging for additional subscriptions from it's customers. It's small price to pay."
"The app unnecessarily overrides my phone's brightness. Why would anyone want two separate brightness settings for the same screen? It's fine to have a brightness slider in the app, but at least read the current brightness level when starting instead of falling back to the value the last time the app was used. On several occassions I've had the pleasure of browsing the app at night (with low screen brightness) only to have the brightness suddenly set to 100% when starting a movie."
"When using the app, there's a glitch when looking for something to watch it sometimes double skips over something. And I made sure no one is on my profile at the same time as me. We all have different profiles. This is actually a big contributer to why I barely use Netflix because it's so annoying. Plus stuff getting canceled as soon it starts getting good, but that's a whole different issue. My main concern is the skipping when looking for something to watch! Please fix this."
"I like Netflix but I am not paying almost $17 for 2 screens at a time, when $6.99 is also 2 screens at a time. Make $17 4 screens at a time"
"Compared to other streaming apps, Netflix has the best format. I do not think that the price increase from $7.99 to $8.99 is justified or warranted because there is never a change or improvement in quality or shows. The only thing that I dislike is that Netflix will edit the show from one day to the next. As if they think that users will not notice that a character's words or clothes have changed. It sort of seems akin to a blooper or blunder."
I love watching in 1.5 or 2.0x speed and I appreciate your effort in finally incorporating it in mobile devices. Is there a way this update will be available soon in Android TVs and Windows version? It's kinda sad watching in small screen but I can't screenmirror my phone to the TV while watching in 1.5 speed because of your security features. Just a black screen with sound and subtitles. So just please put 1.5/2.0 speed feature on android tv update too.
"Badly need an ""in-app"" button to ""Delete Shows from your watched list!"" This alone will generate more accurate ""suggested movie/show lists."" How many times have you made a ""bad"" movie/show choice that will now be forever on your watched list till you jump through 10 hoops to delete? Available language(s) should also be included in the show description!"
"I have been a netflix user for a good 8+ years. This is the first time I've ever had anything bad to say. I absolutely love netflix. However, I guess with this last update, it took away the ""picture-in-picture"" feature. I enjoyed having netflix minimized while i worked on other things. Now, i no longer have that privilege.. Please please fix this. I will put back to 5 stars once that is done!!!"
Needs a way to to sort movies and shows by country and/or language.
love the app. but since the update I have a difficult time loading anything. I have to restart the app two or three times before anything will load. and I cant download any more than three episodes of anything....which is a huge issue for me because I live in one of those unheard of places without cell reception of any kind. please help!
"The app is great but it keeps giving an error (5.10) when I play the video after pausing it, I tried restarting the app and my phone, even updated the android version but this issue still seems to persist"
"It's a nice app overall, but I keep having problems when downloading movies or episodes... when I download a few movies or mainly episodes and lose connection I have to cancel all current downloads and download the ones that didnt download because they just wont start downloading... It's quite frustrating when I have download 10episodes and only 2 get downloaded because I lost my connection and then when I get back I have to cancel all 8 episodes and re download. A fix would be nice!"
It's Netfix but it no longer lives up to that name. I haven't used Netflix maybe 6 times last year because of the lack of content I like. Once again when my wife is done we will cancel subscription. Even my wife is losing interest in this app. So many other apps have the same content and at times is cheaper to sub to that netflix. Overall it's netfix but with half the content it used to have. And nothing good in the future as seen in you coming soon to netlfix section. Losing interest quick!
"Everything is great except how it interacts with my Chromecast. It always disconnects and I have to close the app to connect again. It doesn't interrupt the show but I can't control the remote for the show (pause, next episode, rewind, etc.) Maybe my Chromecast is too old? Either way it's an annoyance."
Brightness scale. Fix it please. Everything else is great but it is even with Night mode where it dyes the screen in red doesn't diffuse its brightness. Everything else meets my personal needs. Please allow a lower brightness setting. I like to watch netflix without interrupting my spouses sleep. She has to wear eye covers and I personally find it too bright as well. Super super please.
"I'm a Blind user of Netflix. all app would be great but there is something not accessible. Subtitles are not read by any screen reader as occurs with all the app. Something curious is that subtitles are read in some cases such as playing the anime ‚ÄúHellsing‚Äù ‚ÄúPsycho pass‚Äù or ‚Äúfull metal alchemist‚Äù But not when I try to play a serie in English with subtitles. No matter what language the subtitle is set, it is not read. The problem occurs when using Netflix in android device, or using it in the PC."
"Was working well for a day or two, but suddenly it keeps freezing. The audio will play but the video is frozen after only 5 mins of playing. I tried different videos and backing out and coming back in. Even tried to uninstall and reinstall twice. I love Netflix and have used it back before it was mostly a streaming site, so I am disappointed in the app. It would be nice to watch a video without having to go back out and back in every 5 seconds."
"Updated on April 14. Now it won't stream anything on Samsung Galaxy s9. Looking for an update to fix the issue. I updated to three starts. I had to sign out of Netflix on my device, then sign in again. That was the solution that worked. Restarting device did not work. I have never had to do that on any device before with this app. Frustrated, but found a fix."
I loved teen wolf but netflix removed it and i couldn't finish the seasons...so
"I loved when they introduced the ""download"" option, because I thought I could store some episodes and movies to watch when I was able, I have quite a busy schedule, watching them online isn't always a possibility... But turns out the app deletes what I downloaded (makes me re-do the download) after some time, even when I haven't watched the episode or movie, I don't like that, I mean I downloaded them in order to watch them when I had the time, but redownloading everything is counter-productive"
Just can't believe that in 2019 this app STILL doesn't have the ability to control video quality in app like every other video app ever made. Yes you can choose in account settings for maximum possible but it is still set to auto based on connection speed. As an Australian with some of the world's worst internet this is a huge problem. When I can manually select 1080p on YouTube my internet runs it fine but the auto (not an option) option on Netflix constantly sets my video to 480p based speed
"Updates in late July TOOK AWAY the ability to increase playback speed altogether. Very disappointing. Jan 2020: Please let me speed up the content on iOS & the Netflix website as well, and allow the fast forward speed to be up to 2x - 3x. Let me choose the audio & subtitle in more than 1 language/with or without audio description when I download titles for office viewing."
"The app is normal, however where is no option to start the show (With new progress) that already been watched. Again there is category ""Resume Watching"" but in reallity you just watch it again and the progress is not recorded and you'd have to take screenshot to remember where you were. Also, while I'm watching I can't take screenshots of my screen."
"The app is good, my only problem with this app is the subtitles, those white font subtitles w/o black background (I dunno if I use the correct term ü•≤) is so hard to read especially if the show is really bright. I wanted to stream my fav anime in legal platform but it's so frustrating that I can't understand what the characters are saying coz I can't see the subtitles."
It's an awesome app i can give full five stars for it because it deserves it........ But since when the app got updated I can't play any video anything without the the error notifications it keep appearing whenever i open the app..... To make the error don't pop up again I have to restart my phone daily its really annoying plz fix the bug Netflix
The service is wonderful but they will change your account type and upcharge you without emailing the account holder to confirm which is upsetting and I don't love the interface. I constantly have to search for the last thing that I was watching because they change the location of that list every single time I check the app. I don't like that you can't get rid of things that you've already seen or that you're not interested in.
"Good app, good service - lousy update! The app does everything I expect for this service. Searching is quick and play back is generally fine, even on a old sm-t800 running Android 6. However after the recent update, the app is consuming 25% of my cpu constantly despite not having in use. No idea what has doing but had to disable it to strip it running my battery down while unplugged. Someone should look at that."
"Hi Netflix - My app was working absolutely fine on my devices and now from past 5 to 6 days, I just don't know what has happened. I am not been able to open vedios neither they get downloaded although there is no Internet connectivity issue as everything else is running smoothly. Please look into it and fix it as its so annoying and frustrating to keep uninstalling and installing and still the result remains the same."
"I Love the app Netflix except for the downfall of some phones. You can't get the picture and picture to work. You know where the little small window pop tap facing? Go to the internet and watch. Show it at the same time, but in another middle of the outlaw, it is fake. The Wi-Fi make if you pay for Netflix. Thanks, what's we all do? Then it should work even if you're not in the Wi-Fi or not no one at work. It should work all fine as well. Not just for downloads It should work online or offline"
"Why put a download button if it's useless? I can stream everything perfectly, no problems there. But whenever I try to download something, it always gets stuck on 98%. Doesn't matter the file size. It could be worth 1GB, or even something as small as 100MB, it always gets stuck on 98%. It never goes past that point. What an inconvenience!!"
Please and please you guys should reduce the way this app sucks mobile data atleast for shows with episodes The rate which the app sucks data is to high and I will like if you guys can reduce the rate thanks
Netflix was good but Now we can't watch it on more than one screen so me and my family have to take turns watching or pay an extra ¬£4 a month for only two screens. It might not be much but with other bills and rent it's not something you can pay. They also transferred everyone to premium without telling the users and we had to switch back. All they care about is getting more money from people honestly has ruined it for me
"always really love the content. love that a variety of shows from different places around the globe is available. that being said i absoulty hate the new set up for how things are displayed on a tablet. the old setting were much easier to handle, and manuver. the fact that i click on a show to get more info about it then it is basically the size of a phone screen on my large tablet is just stupid."
"On several devices the app (up to date) turns to a black screen a few minutes into a show or movie, sometimes even halfway. It usually starts with hitches and then we know that a ""black-out"" is on the way. When it it finally done loading the home screen again, the video starts way before where you left off. Also; on my Galaxy S9 (fully up to date) I have disabled ""Notifications"" in the app, but I still get random notifications about stuff that is on my list or has been added. Very annoying!"
"Autoplay changes are frustrating. It used to wait until the end of credits, then it was 30 seconds for some shows and 60 for others. Now it's 5 seconds for everything, which makes it impossible to go back and listen to credits music. Autoplay timer should be configurable, or there should be a button to delay until after credits. Or at least make it toggleable in app so you don't have to log in via browser to change preferences."
"Its great when it works but seriously! Sometimes I can't watch anything on this app. It gets so frustrating when in the middle of a movie, it just starts buffering and then ends with an error message saying ""this video cant be played."" I know that it isn't my connection because I can watch it on the web app. Please fix this."
The app is great except for the casting icon that is now on the bottom right corner and blocks access to movie/shows selections and play options. You should take into consideration to move it somewhere where it would not constrain the user experience. Thank you
"Only only issues with the app would be the following: 1. Poor responsiveness relating to audio adjustment and control (I often find the app decides to auto set the volume to 100%, and has a substantial delay in allowing me to adjust it, and at times will not allow me to adjust at all, I would say this occurs roughly 4/10 times, so seems to be somewhat random) 2. The most frustrating is the reliability of the app, expect constant resets and reinstalls due to unresponsiveness"
App is great as always but recently they have changed the captions and its not a good viewing experience. The caption is now just flat and white. So when watching a scene that's very bright or white. You can't see the captions. Please bring back the shadows on the captions. It's especially important when watching a show that's in an another language.
"It has gotta alot better, just need more updated horror movie.I gave it 3stars because it's doesn't give us an option to logout. If you log into your account at someone's place you have to look on YouTube and follow all these steps, or you have to go login to your account on the WEBSITE not the app and logout of all devices that way...instead of Netflix just making it easy for us navigate better"
"Netflix Original Improved. I hope they also improve their movies selection. Please get rid of old TV shows that were cancel on their networks. Movies needs to be current also, interesting and entertaining. TV Shows that finished their run on networks do not needs to be repeat on Netflix. Use that space for Live concerts or Sports events similar to pay for view. I do enjoy Netflix when I find something worth watching. Please make better improvements so: my comments won't be so long."
"The apps not bad at all my family have it on their device, but when your paying for the premium account and end up with the lower package I think you have the right to be upset. Plus they'll have a movie on there for more than a month or so when we joined, but then suddenly it will be missing out of the whole system. Movies and series have also been taken out of my list and are no longer in exsistents. just means that we may not even bother using this streaming service again."
At first i was enjoying Netflix but for almost a month ago it started malfunctioning. I always experience error while playing videos i downloaded. Its just frustrating because i am using my mobile data to download but whenever i am going to play it offline. It shows error. I guess this is the 5th time i uninstall and reinstall Netflix to fix the problem but it still goes the same.
I usually really enjoy the convenience of watching Netflix as it easy to pick up where you left off. Currently I am not seeing any decent movies. I DON'T speak spanish and see too many latin American productions. Some of the shows have become more and more violent and disturbing. Visuals agressive and totally despicable in terms of subject matter that is an abomination....disgusting!!!! In shaping young minds a lot of what is on is Visual pollution.
I used to be able to connect to my chromecast before starting the shows. Since the last update i can no longer cast to my chromecast without first starting the program and then telling it to cast. The icon on the home screen is missing. Love the app. Its just a bug or unclearly labeled new feature to establish connection
"My netflix keeps sticking when watching movies. I have tried uninstalling it and reinstalling but it did not help, i have also checked to ensure that the internet and my phone is not the problem which leads me to believe that the problem is Netflix. I hope you can clear this up for me. Other than that it will be appreciated if there is a wider diversity of movies. Thank you."
I would have given it a 5 star if we could watch movies while being on a voice call
"Great app, I love It, sensational in fact but... they need to fix some major bugs and issues which are affecting the app a lot. These include the not loading the app properly and taking many tries to get it to work, the one I've experienced more which is were half the movies don't load on my phone but they do on the smart tv or my pc and the last one is about listening, I bet they have lost hundreds of thousands of people due to them not listening or helping out with a common problems. Pls fix!"
"UK version is really üí©. You realise when you want to watch certain things to find out they're not on yours, but on others (in different countries, mainly the US). Its got half if not less of the actual shows, but if you have a vpn it's fine. UK Netflix, step your game up, I'm disappointed!"
"Frankly a really good app. My experience, however, is marred by the display and the limited ability to make adjustments. The brightness, while warm, I find too dark. Made worse is whenever there happens to be text or subtitles, then the picture becomes an occluded background to the text. It's disappointing that the app overrides the native device display controls in this case. Also, creating some opacity in subtitles would be nice."
"was really fun for a long time. but this app has really grown bad with age. loosing a ton of content to new streaming services. so now Netflix is left with very little other then the awful sequels of movies, b movies, and original content which the original content is hit and miss has some good originals like stranger things, voltron, and a few more."
"Not enjoying the latest update. I get the ""why"" behind it (TikTok envy), but the endless scrolling makes it harder to navigate. (Related: Just move ""My List"" to the homepage, Netflix--please!) You're also at the whim of Netflix's recommendation engine, with no noticeable way to dismiss a title from the home screen. (""Watch 'The Queen'!"" Netflix yells at me when I open the app. ""No!"" I scream, and then Reed Hastings shows up at my door with a menacing smile on his face.)"
"It's cheap, and it's all I have other than antenna, but still close to being overpriced. I use the Upflix app too see all new additions to the Netflix lineup, and there are over 100 each month, but rarely anything I'd want to watch. TV shows are ok, but slow to be released. The documentaries can be interesting."
"The movies and series are good, and I love the reasonable quality on my slow connection. The dynamic quality chooser rocks. But there are so many app errors that make me reinstall. I hate having to redownload. This kind of thing is happening so often that I am going to get an apk so I can sideload whenever this happens so I don't have to keep on downloading it. This workaround only works because I am nerdy enough to do it. This problem needs a solution for the regular person."
"Not really spoilt for choice when it comes to uk Netflix. Would like to see things like Wentworth, Walkung Dead and/or Buffy on there. . I do love Netflix and I've had it for years but I do have to leave it for a month or two before coming back to watch anything so programmes and movies can build up or I find myself watching the same things over and over. And now today I cant even get on the app.. ü§îü§êü§®üôÑ"
"Love Netflix, we don't get tv reception where we live so we rely on Netflix. One thing I would like to see is more new content, although there is always something to watch, I think Netflix should add a feature where any movie you have watched won't show up unless you go to "" already watched"" I'm browsing through the same stuff every month, it's a bit annoying, but thank you for your service."
Not too much good because when we search a movie It can't open and played.
I love Netflix and the app but my little issue with the app is that some of my downloaded series and movies tend to disappear like hours after downloading. Usually they leave a warning that so and so is going to expire in so and so time but now most of the time my stuff just vanishes without any prior warning. I hate this and I would like to know what the issue is.
"I love Netflix but idk if it's just my phone or the app but if I still have it open in a tab (like I pause and go to another app) and on the other app if I play some video or something with a sound, the audio of the show I'm watching on netflix starts playing right after that... I hope that makes sense because I wish it can be fixed, it's really annoying because I didnt press play or anything so it plays it without me watching it"
They need to change up the movies its gotten boring.
"When it works, it's amazing, but it doesn't always. Has a lot of great series and movies (give me back Doctor who üò°), the problem is that the video player rarely works on the first try. The problem can usually be solved by restarting your device, but that gets annoying the 3rd time you have to do it in a week. If that gets fixed, it's 5 stars"
"The app is fine and it works great. I use it when I'm working in the kitchen and want to continue binge watching my shows. But Netflix...seriously? First, you raise your prices ridiculously, then you stop offering much outside your original content anymore unless you want to pay even more for dvds, and now you want to delayed release season finales of shows? Such a middle finger to loyal customers. We Netflix to binge, stop giving us some. We want the whole thing, and we certainly pay for it."
"App UI and features are fine but there's a huge bug that I run into occasionally. This doesn't always happen but whenever I try to play an episode of any show, my phone instantly restarts. I've never had this issue with any of my other apps and it always happen with Netflix. Please fix!"
"I like Netflix. I've been with this company since you were sending movies through the mail. Prices haven't been that great as they climb every year, despite being a loyal customer since the beginning. With this update, I cannot watch a movie on my home screen and use other apps simultaneously. I usually do 20 things at once and this has always been beneficial for me. This new update is garbage and should go back to what it was."
"One app update could make the battery on your Android phone last longer Posted on May 17, 2019 by Authcom Update Your Netflix. In theory, the ability for mobile apps to run in the background is a welcome one. It‚Äôs a pain to have to fully reload an app every time you want to use it, and background apps have made this issue mostly obsolete. But this functionality occasionally comes at a cost, as technology firm Mobile Enerlytics recently discovered. In a blog post this we"
"I've liked Netflix for a while but lately it's not been working and it's really annoying. I was just trying to make it not ""For Kids"", but when I tryed to change the profile, it would just load forever. And the for kids setting is very limited. For teens who's parents are strict, it's hard finding movies to watch when it's all just shows for small children. And the documentary section is awful, and also very limited. I think some changes the app and a software update would fix the problem."
"Love this app. There is one VERY big problem, though. It will not download on my Samsung tablet. I have downloaded this to my phone and have it on my TV but it will refuse to download on my tablet. Before you say anything, I have tried clearing space and trouble shooting but it still will not work. Also my internet has worked all the times I tried it. Other than this, it is a wonderful app."
Definitely enjoy Netflix movies like the person above and below but I watch across devices including my phone and xbox which normally I have my phone mirror it to my xbox or tv but yet somehow when I switch devices I get gapped in episodes. Ex: watching ash vs evil dead turned it on and I was literally a season behind but yet literally just watched a episode not even a few seconds before I switched? How does that work? Fix it Super annoying
"They keep removing all the amazing movies and shows like Julie and the phantoms or coraline and honestly a lot of others. That only leaves us with the trashy shows, and some shows aren't complete I have to go to another app to watch the rest of the show.but the no adds is amazing and being able to skip intro or recap is nice.i like how u can just remove things from the continue watching it just makes me feel tidy like I just cleaned up all the things I don't like."
"App works fine on my other devices but when running on a Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2019 Model), videos frequently freeze on a single frame or a black screen with audio still playing, and need to be restarted (multiple times in some cases) before they play correctly. Disclaimer on the app says it ""may not be optimized"" for this device but I don't know how that's the case, considering it runs on older and less powerful devices without issue."
"Layout and format is good. However I find content lacking and hard to find. Many times the search feature brings up movies but not the one your looking for even though it is in Netflix's library. Many titles you have to dig deep for because the search function won't bring up the title. Plus, 4k should be what ALL movies and shows are formatted in but nope, just 720p or maybe 1080p instead. 8k TV's are coming out and content providers STILL don't release titles in 4k yet. Why? Netflix increased their membership fees again yet it's not like they increased their 4k content or libraries by a noticeable amount of titles. Needs a lot more 4K to be competitive in this day and digital age with Fandango, Amazon Prime, Sony 4k movies, etc."
"I'm having this one problem with the app that i never had before and it's bothering me a lot. The thing is, everytime i open the app and watch something on it my notifications bar turn black and then when i close the app it's still black and I can't push the notifications bar down only if i reboot my phone and this happens every single time i open the app and i have to reboot everytime. Do you guys know why this is happening?"
Almost perfect. It is 2022 and there is no option to customize subtitles on the app? Very very frustrating to watch non english shows when the white subtitles completely blend into bright scenes and become unreadable. Ridiculous that there is such an accessibility issue when every other streaming service offers the option to change subtitles. *EDIT I found the setting after having to google it. you should not habe to hunt for settings. why is it not just in the acct settings? not user friendly
I've always thought it was an incredible app but recently I'm quite annoyed about the unequal distribution of contents in the different countries. In my opinion you should publish all the English contents in all the countries at the same time even if there's not yet the translation or the subtitles from English. Hope you will soon fix this small issue.
It seems like they're just lazy and don't care they just want their money. It's annoying when you like have three movies in a series and Netflix only has for example of number one and number three. I don't think too many people are into reading subtitles when they want to watch a movie you should have a section that states it's going to be subtitled movie can't stand get an excited about a movie and then oh. You would think they would put a little extra effort during the pandemic.
"I would give more stars, however for the month i have not been able to check any upcoming shows or movies to remind when when it comes out. I have even notified Netflix through chat and told them the problem and I was told that they would fix the problem ASAP. Well that was over 2 weeks ago. This is very frustrating. I have done all of the updates, even uninstalled and reinstalled and that has not fixed the problem. Please fix the problem, and i'll fix my rating."
"It's a decent platform. Large selection of limited greatness. There are some gems to be found. It's also better at remembering what you've watched than other video entertainment platforms, though not perfect. The price is competitive but depending on how much you watch movies or shows, may not be ideal. I pay for 1 screen and it pretty much breaks even if I were to just rent the movies I watch."
It's quit complicated as I want to change my plan and update no any simple otion is there ans I am not able to access
App does not allow you to set minimum brightness that phone supports.
Mostly anime content is in Japanese & Same content available in English on aniwatch which is freeüòÅ
I paid right note my Netflix but it was not working with payment method..
"Been a customer forever, but I'm not loving the fact that my floating screen isn't working anymore..."
"its not working for me, when i try to watch when i m in loading t sundenlly auto back at home screen"
"I love to shows, but there are a lot of collections. I think there's a lot that could be doneüòÅ"
"When watching any show there's no problem, but when we want to watch Dexter, there's a screeching aound. What's wrong please?"
To many old shows and movies streaming. Need new.
Console version's controls are totally unreliable.
Dear Netflix I was very satisfied with your performance infact I was gonna give you guys a 5 star review but then only recently I found out that you guys TOOK OFF S2 OF FRUITS BASKET!! why did you do that do you know how much that anime means to me?? It has helped me through a lot of dark times in my life and I love it with all my heart so please I'm begging you guys to bring s2 of fruits basket and I will give a 5star review. Thank u for your time (please accept my request )
"As the new update, my account is always getting log out. I dunno what is happening"
We need netflix kinds not in profile . Should be great to an separe app only with kids profile and restrictions
"-Add options to change quality of videos directly like youtube , both on Pc And phones."
Shows randomly appear and disappear on s24 ultra specifically.
Works ok but sometimes buffers on my 1gbps/1000mbps internet.
There's some speed problem video plays later but the sound come first
It was good before I found out there GETTING RID OF THE OLD MEAN GIRLS movie so and they keep getting rid of great movie
Some anime have very long titles. I can see only 2 lines üòÇ
"Error cod tvq-pb-101 (5.2.5) all the time, paying for pain i think"
App is frequently freezing. Home page itself not loading
Doesn't have much options and for some reason it keeps on signing me out every two days or so
Please help me out... I brought a subscription on my mobile but after few days I brought a new mobile & Linked Netflix subscription but now I am not able to download any thing now...!!! I am one of ur new subscriber please help me out
why when i watched a tv show the screen becomes thin and compressed. its like a movie or series from youtube that you watch for free. i watch the Avatar last air bender.
good app just that some of the movie I watched I can't see the season 2 just like cursed
It was the best app before but not now Because when I am trying to sign in some error are coming
"Used to be all good with offline, but now there's nothing in there, all vanished, and I can't add anything either. It says I have downloads on too many devices (nql.23000), which is just a joke, as I obviously do not, I'm accessing it through the same phone. I've got a plane in a couple of hours, and it doesn't look it can be resolved by that. Disgrace. ///Fixed through a desktop version of the website, but still the fact you just can ""forget"" my device in moment like this is not cool at all."
"Started sending notifications, despite them being switched off in app settings. Thankfully, Android gives me the option of force disabling notifications in the OS. Can't rate the app - probably never used it. Only keep it just in case I find myself in a situation (yet to ever arise) where I want to watch Netflix on my phone."
"Was very content with the app and service overall until recently, I wanted to re-watch a series but the subtitle from season 1&2 disappeared while season 3&4 have plenty of options. I had problems with missing subtitles in my language in the past but overlooked them because I understand they can't provide subtitles for EVERYTHING at once. I tried putting myself in contact with help center but it's not working very well."
"Seems to be really buggy. I love the variety of shows and movies, but the bugs just ruin the experience. When ever I'm watching something I keep constantly getting disconnected from my wifi. This isn't happening with any other app. I'll spend 2 hours on YouTube, nothing, but 3 minutes on Netflix, disconnected. Skipping could also be better. You can't skip 20, 30, 40, etc at a time like YouTube. You constantly have to skip 10 seconds. Actually on the topic of that, it isn't 10 seconds. It semms to just skip to the nearest 5th second. I'll press the skip forward 10 seconds button at 3:38 and be put at 3:40. Very weird."
"After being a customer for several years and only using Netflix to watch TV/Films I am struggling to find new content, with most of the suggestions now being foreign titles. I sometimes have issue with the casting function of the app - wanted to watch season 1 again before watching a new season but it cast the new episode even when I selected season 1 episode 1. Casting controls can be hit and miss too, with them not loading correctly on all pages of the app. Served me well, but time to move on."
"To many subtitles and non English audio. I like some of the foreign movies just get tired of reading about 90% of them, and it's more tv shows than movies now. I like some of your originals alot, but again you have mostly foreign movies more than American films, even some of the voice editing sucks, it's like flip a coin and see what you get. Theirs plenty of tv shows that went off in one season you could have taken over, instead you invest mostly in foreign films with heavy accents."
"Although Netflix is a wonderful streaming app, most of the good animated movies from the 2010s aren't on Nextflix anymore; and every time they add one of those movies, it's one there for a short amount of time. Take Megamind, Shrek, The Grinch, etc. for example, they were on Netflix for a decent amount of time, but not as long as I would think/hope."
"Still a good app, but it keeps on glitching for the past few weeks, i do not what's happening so i tried installing it again but then it didn't stop, the audio can be heard but the video would stop and sometimes it would skip some parts, hopefully you'll fix this so it won't really bother the subscribers. Thanks"
"I would rate more stars but this app has some issues. It likes to log me out while viewing, or log me out when I am trying to rewind or start an episode over. It is quite annoying to deal with. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app many times and I am still having this recurring issue. I use this app on a Galaxy 8 so there should be no problems like this."
"Tho I have never had a real problem with this app. Aka: Always loads, Plays through, No stuff ups. The biggest problem is that they are slack on updating movies and tv shows. As in that you search for something you want to watch and you can't find what your looking for tho it comes up in the search it only shows you simaler movies"
It works OK I guess. I hate trying to watch anything on my phone really but some times it's all I have. I really perfer my pc so I can use my browser extensions and give Netflix the features it should already have by default but don't. At the end of the day I'll probably be canceling my subscription in the next month or 2 because I swear it's like they only got about 30 movies on the whole platform because nothing really new ever gets recommended. I often just find myself watching YouTube.
"Works like it's supposed to. Has a lot of trashy stuff I don't want to see but most video apps do. However, when finding something to watch if my kid is around , I have to be extra careful, because they shamelessly play trailers and auto play TV shows/movies etc that are super inappropriate that my kid my accidentally see, even stuff I Do Not want to see. The auto play feature is horrible on Netflix and completely annoying. That's why I rate this as a 3 star. Only has errors when update needed"
"Not enough movies available examples= chennai express,student of the year2 etc"
"I Enjoy the movies when it does right but half time the movies want load when it comes up ready to cast on the TV no matter what I do and it keeps changing the way I have to do it and sometimes it never loads also tonight I'm having trouble logging into Netflix, sometimes this happens not often with logins and I have strong service on my smartphone but I'm aggravated the way the app keeps doing pretty much ever since I got it but I really do enjoy the movies when I've had them. I want to keep it"
The new interface is horrible. Instead of swiping up and down for a quick category view and then left and right to take a quick peek at what is interesting. Its now a tedious process where you have to manually select a category from a menu and then scroll up and down one by one per film to see what interest me. It takes like 3x more time.
"A still good but rapidly declining app. Quality & volume of content has been in decline for years. The app itself similarly gets worse every year or so, and the descriptions of the shows betray how little effort Netflix cares to put into the presentation as many of them don't even tell you what the movie is about simply saying movie stars X actor or Y person said it was good. If even Netflix doesn't care enough about their content to tell you what it is then that's a pretty damning indictment."
"Loved the app until a week or two ago. It now randomly starts playing my show/movie unless I completely exit and shut down the app every time I need to leave it. I liked having the ability to go check some notifications or make a phone call then return back to the app and pick up where I left off, but I can't do that now without it starting playing in the background (sound, no picture)."
Subscription fees keeps increasing. It is so annoying my favourite shows such as vampire diaries & the 70s show were removed. Hoping they will add more better shows and movies in the future. Also it would be very helpful if there is a watch later feature so I can keep track of all the shows I am planning to watch. Please make it worth what I am paying for every month.
"It works fine but I'm becoming more and more annoyed with Netflix because of so many good movies and series being taken down for some dumb ""Assi Tv"" but on the other hand also increasing the prices. What's the point of paying for it when i can't even keep on watching my favorite movies. Seriously considering to switch onto another app."
"Netflix in general gets a 5 star from me, however, a recent change in the app has removed my ability to pause and play while on a call. I watch exclusively on my phone and sometimes watch the same thing at the same time as a friend or loved ones who are long distant. It helps me sync up manually. Please bring that ability back."
This app has been driving me crazy for the past few weeks. Can't go forward or backward in any video without freezing the video. The only way to get Netflix to start playing again is by restating the app. The price keeps going up but the quality seems to be going down for the android app. Netflix do something about it!
"Netflix has the best user interface by far and great original content but I dislike the fact that too much content is region locked and the thing that irks me the most is actually the lack of volume equalization, I'm so sick of not being able to hear conversations then almost blow the speakers on my tv the second there's a gun fight or car chase. Yes I have tried switching from 5.1 to stereo where applicable, i think it helps slightly but it's negligible. Please for the sake of my sanity, fix."
"How do you turn of audio description on Android!! I don't need a commentary on my navigation around the app. For instance, I don't need to be told I'm on the home screen in the middle row of popular on Netflix by a female voice over. I know I'm there I pressed the buttons!! I've checked settings online and in the app , but there doesn't seem to be a way to turn it off."
"The more I use this app the more I feel limited/bored. I would like a better search filter to find shows that appeal to me. I also hate the disappointed of finding an amazing show with only 1 season. I want better control over my ""list"" with an archive option to separate what I have already watched; as I may want to rewatch them later. This million dollar algorithm doesn't get me. As for the kids netflix I want better control on what my child can watch as well as more educational shows"
"I absolutely love Netflix, but since the new update I'm not able to log on, it will tell me I have the wrong email or password. the other thing it will do is say they are not able to connect to the server. I've double triple checked to make sure I got it all right. but still 3 days in a row I'm not able to get on my account. I did try uninstalling the app and restarting but yet again still it is doing the same thing. other than whatever is going on this moment I totally would give 5 stars."
"The app has recently updated to have the cast button in the lower right hand corner which covers the stop button. That is minor compared to the frustration that comes from playing the next episode in a show after the current episode is complete. The app has no option to continue to the next episode. I have to go back to the main menu, refresh it, then locate the show I was watching and press play. This app seems to be only getting worse."
"As a user, I hate the new menu that shows on the bottom of the screen when I click on a title... It doesn't show the entire description.. So I have to click twice to see it... It's so boring. I used to feel the navigation very intuitive, now feel like there's always a lock to open to get what I want. Even if I would just play the tittle, the number of clicks would be the same. Please consider my comment... Test things with real users to their opnions on stuff before adding they."
"This app is very enjoyable, where movies and TV shows co-op with Netflix. The app was good until a recent update appears. There's a problem, that keep getting us into update payment. Even though I paid for it, it didn't go away. It just stay in place and I can't download and watch any movies, because of that. I really appreciate this app, but please, please update to get rid of the bug. Thank you!"
"I love to binge watch on Netflix all the time especially when my friends are over and we are bored of doing other things!! It's a very good app but I think there could be a few small changes.. First, I HATE when it takes long for it to load into the menu where you can select a Movie or TV-Show. Second, It's also very annoying when it says ""Sorry You're Not Connected to Any Wi-Fi, Please Re-Load."" Even when I am connected to the Wi-Fi and have full bars!! Please try to fix this Netflix Creators.."
"the shows and movies are great but there's always problems right? when I restart my phone, my downloaded shows and movies suddenly can't be played? I wasted my data and time downloading those! no, it doesn't happen once, but A LOT OF TIME! when i go to the FAQ, it says to restart your phone/app or just uninstall and install it back, in other way saying that I should just download the shows back! please fix this, not all people have Wi-Fi and unlimited data! Please fix this!"
I thought the updated version would brings me to a great experience to watching but turns out upsetting. Most time when i moving forward a scene and there you go it got stucked in between and leave the audio play by itself. It kinda annoying and thought it was my phone problem but as it seem most of my friends actually face the same problem so dear netflix please fix this. Same thing happened for couple of week since i got my app updated. It was perfect before i got my app updated. Tq.
"where are the the enormous amount of movies to select from? I've seen more selections on show box, movie hd, and other apks that have more movies to select from. if you have them show them when I download the app please so we can see what we are paying for. I have had Netflix for about 1 and half months and find it highly dissapointing . movies do not update or change and charge too much for only a few movies. overrated is too nice a word."
"It works the same as on a console or computer which is nice but the UI is annoying cuz you uave to scroll through the suggestions and ""whats hot"" lists to find your list and continue watching buried in, also it drops my video quality toan unwatchable degree if i use a bluetooth speaker which sucks because my phone speakers are garbage so if they can make it more user friendly and fix that issue ill update my review"
"We have had Netflix for years and they have tons of tv shows to pick from which is great for those who want to watch TV shows. The movie selection has become boring. The horror genre is mainly not in English, I am fine with that except the are very few horror flix that are worth watching and the ones that look good have an English title but are in another language and you don't know that until you start watching it. I love scary movies and the selection on Netflix is terrible."
"Chat function is severely broken, and call support function doesn't fully close in my phone so I have to reboot. I tried to contact support about offline downloads that were no longer available, even though I have not left the country. For some reason the chat is horribly broken (doesn't let you delete, or autocorrext, and didn't let me connect to an agent)."
"I only gave this app 3 stars because they dont have certain progams available in certain locations. For example, Studio Ghibli movies. I am a huge fan of their movies, but I have no where to watch them. I heard they were coming out on Netflix, I check, theyre not there. I search it up on Google, its not available in my location cause ""other streaming services in my location have these movies."" So basically, I either have to pay for ANOTHER service or move to a location where its available. Smh"
Netflix has always had good content although in recent months there has been changes that are super beneficial within the app. Auto brightness no longer works with the app and when switching between apps or shutting off my phone while my film or show is paused causes it to continue in the background for no reason.
"honestly I used to really like Netflix. unfortunately there hasn't been great content recently. Another thing to consider with other streaming services holding rights to many of Netflix old shows (Disney&Hulu) Netflix isn't a must have anymore. The biggest issue is while quality is going down cost is going up. my family of 4 has the $10.99 plan. when we first got this all of us could share with little problem. slowly the plan has been reduced from, I think, 4 screens to just 1. I'm over Netflix"
"When exiting the app, the now playing notification stays in the notification tray persistently and will not go away until the app is fully closed. The notification is already useless: it has no playback controls and I'm pretty sure I can see the video that's on screen, why is it in the notification tray at all?? Making it persistent makes it just that much more annoying."
"I love Netflix, but I'm so bloody sick of - A) having to click on my profile everytime I open the app; and B) having to turn off subtitles everytime I change shows or open the app. These aren't massive problems but this never used to happen. Change it back please! Also - too much original content and My List needs to be filterable."
2020 August upgrade sucks! Had to reinstall due to error & it is horrible! I used to play Netflix minimized while playing a game but after reinstalling now it stops if I close the game & I have to continually close & re-open Netflix as it stops & won't replay. Bummer! YouTube movies are free & becoming more entertaining than whatever Netflix is starting to become anyway. I wonder how Covid effects actors like if they can do kissing scenes now or what.. are movies even being made anymore?
"Portrait mode on tablet or phone Hope you put Portrait mode on this application, because some of the devices like my tablet that installed on the car are permanently in Portrait position. whenever i use netflix on my tablet, the video is cropted or basically zoom in half. I only see middle part. I am sad that i cant enjoy netflix like in my tv and phone. üò≠ hope you considered to put Portrait mode. Thank you netflix."
"Netflix is great but I wish there is a sorting function in My List where I can separate the dramas that I have and haven't watched. And, sometimes, when I wanted to continue on watching the drama (Resume), it continued on with the wrong episode. For example, I have watched until Episode 6, the next time I want to continue watching, it continues on with much previous episode and not Episode 7. I also don't like when Netflix put up a new show or drama but it does not have the complete season."
"I love netflix and it's contents, especially now that they are adding more original movies and series, and anime & kdramas. I just HATE that in my phone app which is where i use and watch netflix more I can't add anything in my favorites list. The app literally won't let me no matter how many times i unistall and install again. I hope you fix this soon please!!!!!"
"This used to work fine on my phone but now for some reason the audio in some movies stops working as the video plays, video stops and audio plays, or even sometimes both audio and video stop. I try skipping ahead and going back to my spot but it rarely fixes the problem, and if it does, its only fixed for a few moments. This has happened in numerous movies ive tried to watch so i try a different movie and the same problem keeps occuring. Its getting on my nerves. Please fix it quickly."
I have been a Netflix subscriber since 2018. I wanted to change to the cheaper option for just one TV/Laptop/Cell at a time as it's only for my husband and myself as we watch together 90% of the time. Sadly I found out that the pic resolution is also downgraded for some unknown reason and the call centre have no real answer for this.... I'm told it's set by the developer and there is no changing the single use to HD or higher.....
"Netflix is great, but the app itself has some issues. You have to tap a movie, then hit 'more info' before you can add it to your 'My List'. This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the fact that the app might not have kept track on your browsing position and you'll end up at the top again. Then since subcategories randomly fail to load, find your way again gets rather finnicky. I preferr to browse via lists, which is not an option. I also feel the current ""simplified"" system burries titles."
"Great app, but I'm sure you already know that. Although, the recent update is not so great. When I got into Netflix after a work filled day, I just want to watch the next episode of the series I'm already into (recently watched category). Now with this new update, I gotta scroll down looking for that category every time, it's stressful and annoying, creating a bad user experience for me. Why not have the recent watched show up 1st on top before trying to show me new movies that I don't care for."
"I did not even update to the newest version after reading about UI change I wouldn't like, however, up until now I've been updating regularly and yet, throughout all those updates, I continue to have the same major issue...The app randomly stopping my show and changing to either the previous episode or entirely different season. Sometimes it happens only once, and sometimes many times in a row after me trying to go back watching my current episode it'll change again. Incredibly frustrating..."
"Subtitles used to be pretty good. The subtitles now are often wrong, slow, or completely skip lines which causes jokes or information pertinent to the storyline to be lost. I also occasionally have issues with connection to my Chromecast. It sometimes doesn't connect or connects for long enough to play a show for awhile then becomes disconnected but the show still plays. Frustrating"
Great content obviously. But subtitles settings are buggy. My smart TV keeps switching the settings back to default -- which is basically like a bright white neon light at the bottom of the screen. Glaring white subtitles are really really bad. I'm watching Witcher S2 and the nice dark room lights up with each line. Had to turn them off it's so bad.
"Man.. The error 5.7 is really annoying. Theres day everything was fine. But most of the time the error keeps showing up after a few minutes watching something.. I have to constantly reopen my movies to finish it! Please fix! I've tried to follow the solution in your website. I've cleared cache, reboot, everything! Still doesn't seems to work.."
"For the most part, great app. Couple issues, the resuming where I left off, something isn't working right and seems it's not just me. Example I start watching episode 5 through 7, turn it off, come back, click play, starts episode 5 again instead of starting on 8. Also, after 3 episodes, please let us have an option to turn the ""are you still there"" off!! Its annoying!"
I have used the previous version of the Netflix and that version UI is really good for browsing and watching favorite shows and movies. Also in this update there are some series and movies are missing. The developer's should include the users requirements in the next update. The UI and the series and movies must be included in the next update.
"I like the content and everything of this app, but the app itself is very glitchy. Try to use instagram while watching something in multitasking, within 5 seconds an error occurs and you have to restart the program. When an episode ends in multitasking mode, the window just closes and you have to reopen the app, where you have to restart it AGAIN to get multitasking to work again. It's pretty cumbersome and I'm amazed they haven't fixed this."
Please add option to sort series which has hindi audio available !
"Since the latest update, when using on my phone, I'm unable to actually search for anything. The same message repeats that they cannot show any results. Also, my watch history is gone, so I have to scroll through the auto-suggested and hope the show I want to watch is on there. Otherwise I have to search for the show/movie on separate browser and be asked to sign into my account, each time."
"The app itself is great but the Dolby Vision is complete garbage, picture is grainy, it does this auto brightness and contrast thing where dark scenes get reallly dark and bright scenes are just as awful but really bright... Also messes with colors... Should do away with it and just use standard 4k for hi def shows... Im not watching any shows in dolby vision no matter how much i like the show (such as The Ranch!) At least add an option to turn this garbage off please!"
"It's great but I don't know if it's just my phone or not but every single thing I try watch, everything seems to have a slight delay on the audio, like the audio will come a little bit after the video shows someone talking, it's not a big deal but it can get annoying quite quickly for me, I've tried several fixes but still hasn't done anything."
"Update: I found answers through Google's forum. I logged in through the website and from there, it took me to the login and the app now works. Whenever I try to open the app it just gives an error code (-9). I cleared the app's data and even reinstalled the app, however, now it doesn't let me past the login screen. This is only happening on my second phone which is pretty old, running on Android 5.1. I love using Netflix and some of my favourite shows are on here, please fix this."
"HELP NETFLIX PLEASE FIX THIS!!! If I finish watching something, it ends then brings me back to Netflix home, its no where to be easily found again! If I can't remember what it was called then I'm completely screwed! I love Netflix longtime customer, but 1 thing thats become a HUGE pet peeve for me is theres no section for ""Already Watched"" movies and shows. Once it finishes, its gone! And you HAVE TO remember the title to type into the search bar if you want to go back to it for whatever reason."
"Was once better. - Chromecast connection still works great - Streaming works flawlessly But recently there are some annoyances - Episodes says sth. like ""click Play to start next episode"" but where is the ""Play"" button? So I have to open list of episodes, find the current one and then start the next one - Selecting a different season is now really hard to achieve, why would you change that? - Not reliably remembering where I stopped watching"
Netflix is awesome! I use it on my TV and Laptop. Love the content. Only issue I face is when I watch it on my phone (Samsung Galaxy Note 9). For some reason in dark scenes the screen becomes horribly pixelated and the colour accuracy goes completely haywire. It's a 5 star app for me if someone can solve this issue for me.
"Dear Netflix, I am laying in bed trying to watch Locke & Key but cannot continuously watch the series because the Netflix app on my streaming device keeps stopping and going to the home screen. I have tried uninstalling and then reinstalling the app to see if that would alleviate the problem. No such luck. I am hoping that someone within their organization sees this review and begins to eliminate the issue. Sincerely one of your loyal customers."
I've heard great about Netflix but I haven't yet to watch a movie I need to get one of them chords to go through my phone to the TV I don't have Smart to transfer a movie from my phone to. While I'm at home.
"Not exactly sure what all the hype was about. This is the first time I've ever had Netflix, and I may cancel soon. Really hard to find programs that I'm actually interested in. Include more programs/movies featuring people from all parts of the African diaspora, especially women, in the most multifaceted, uplifting light."
"Of course it's nice to have a place to browse movies and episodes, but unfortunately their downloads don't last long. I had downloaded stuff for when I would have no access to phone service or wifi, and a lot of my stuff expired before I got to watch (well, finish) any of it within a 2 week period. I understand why, sorta. Still feels frustrating"
Love the app and love netflix in general. I've been having some problems with the app though. It freezes up on me in the middle of episodes and makes me restart the entire app. Just tonight I played one of the episodes and my netflix completely refreshed. Is there a way we can fix these problems???
This classic app just got a huge update to its interface and it is awful!! It now looks like a social media feed. You see less options and it feels like you're just seeing very targeted/trending suggestions. None of that is what I want. I pray to god there's another update coming that will change the interface back to the way it was. I will be on this app less because of the new interface.
"Netflix going down the hill. I used to enjoy it every day. For the last few months it made me irritated. The amount of good series isn't sufficient. The ones that really interesting ate either not available for downloading or there is always a problem. I have been trying to download New Girl series for the past week and it either disappeared off the list or was giving me an error. Very bad, guys, you need to improve your service."
"This app is ok, but at the same time its straight up doo doo. Yea, you can watch any shows and movies the app offers easily, but usually they're trashy 5 year old shows or boring 17 year old movies and theres definitely not enough shows and movies that are in between that age range. Unfortunately, im between that age range so this app is pretty much useless."
Been having a lot of issues lately with my progress being saved on episodes. The episode will revert back to a previous time I watched. Apparently I also can not watch an episode while I'm on break at work if anyone in my family is using Netflix at home. We only have it for one household now and on my phone as well as my husband's. Oh well I guess. The new One piece live action has turned out really good though
"I use to love netflix. Been using it for 3 years now. But as of the last 3 months, I have nothing but problems. One day it works okay, the next day I cant sign in, wont load shows, if it does start playing it constantly freezes or quits playing and goes black. And now they charge more for worse service. Please fix these issues Netflix."
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Netflix and the app, have been a loyal customer for years and never had an issue until today. For some reason the brightness adjustment in-app has disappeared, so now video shows super dim in full-screen mode on my S10 and when I try to adjust the brightness from my phone directly it doesn't work, the video is still the same dimness. Idk who deleted what chunk of code in this latest update, but if y'all could put it back that would be great."
"Always loved Netflix App up untill recently, there's bug fixes that need to be done... Even after all maintenance such as clearing app settings, clearing all cache and data, allowing all permissions , uninstalling and reinstalling, rebooting the phone... The app continues to show a black screen and you can only hear the audio. Please fix this üôè"
"Hi Netflix, can you please remove the brightness toggle from the player again? I find it very inconvenient: I want to use the brightness which my phone is using and I noticed when sliding up from the side of the screen to get the Android controls the brightness gets changed again. So please remove it again, just like the way it was or otherwise make it an option to disable it please. Thanks!"
"generally, it's good, actualy? it's flawed. I can't login to the app on my phone anymore, even when I get the correct password. I have tried multiple ways of fixing this but nothing has worked. also, netflix has lost its great movies for Netflix originals and unknown TV shows and movies. I do recommend this app but I am not proud of what it had become."
"The Netflix video quality looks like it is only playing sd instead of hd. I already set my streaming quality to high. In the Netflix app settings it says maxium resolution is sd when my device is capable of playing hd video. I looked at the help center and apparently you need to have a specific device or chip for it to play hd video. Which is weird because I can play hd on YouTube. So it's a disappointment, since I can't watch HD content on my tablet. It looks fuzzy"
"First time writing a review for an app - everything works great actually but I would like to ask the developers if there has been known incidents where the app just crashes the whole phone when one opens the app - just to be clear its not the app that crashes, my phone sometimes just shuts down and restarts when I open the app and click on a show to watch. Im using Huawei Mate 20 Pro and its only been a month since I started using it. Appreciate any kind of assistance! Many Thanks."
"Seem to be having problems with pausing, continuing etc via the notification bar/ not appearing at all??? Since the latest update of app. Have to reopen app to get notification bar to work or appear. Please give the option in setting to enable or disable the option of are you still watching? Slightly frustrating when you watching series that's only 30 min and after 3 ep stops to ask you if you watching. I would of stopped streaming if I'd stopped?"
"Would have given more stars since it works great domestically but if you travel abroad and think using the download feature will work great ‚Äî Be Warned: it will only let you watch shows you download that are also available on your 'native' Netflix. If you download shows available where you are currently traveling that are NOT available where you reside, it will give you an annoying not available in your area message"
I would like to install the gta games on my phone but it is not compatible. Could you please enable compatibility? The non Netflix versions of these games can be installed on my phone. Thanks
"Netflix, whereas I love you services at a reasonable price with your unique movies and Netflix series, I'm extremely irritated at your abandoned material. There are series that you've cancelled and left with an unfinished ending. You remove content to make room for more but you'll leave these on, which capture the attention of your viewers just to leave us on edge with no intentions of a finale series. Suggestion, make one more episode or series and finish the story or just remove it altogether."
No problem streaming or anything but not being able to share with your family just because there not in the same house is kinda annoying. I can understand if there's a lot of people on there but when there's only 4 accounts I feel it shouldn't matter.
I can't play Netflix in Full HD format because I just upgrade my samsung A53 software into the latest one. please making upgrade app so I can play it in FHD format again. Thank you
"The app is amazing, only reason that it doesn't have a 5 star is bcuz of the fact that most of my favorite shows get canceled and left on cliff hanger by Netflix for no reason. Ex: Julie and the phantoms, raising dion, comn netflix"
"No complaints about content, I've loved Netflix since the good ol' DVD days. But the forced rotation on playback for Samsung Z Folds needs to be fixed. When opened, the Z Fold is basically a square screen. It doesn't need to be rotated. Please make it optional, pretty please? Or tranversely, don't force portrait mode for the menu for the same exact reason. Just have free rotation."
The download feature is ridiculous. Why do i have to download the same thing over and over. I only download shows for my toddler for when we are out and i check today and everything i previously downloaded is now deleted. How does that make sense.
Turkey's Netflix has much less content than normal Netflix and there is nothing left to watch. Isn't it possible to transfer all the content as it is? Nonsense.
After last update there is a problem with subtitles. Always changes to EN subtitles on samsung mobile. On android TV it is ok.
"Hey, Netflix most of indain people so kannadigas very intaligent and brilliant people, why many series don't subtitles and dubbed. Its very same Netflix. You have time put subtitled for mallu sex films industry. Bloddy you don't have great lagendry star's in Karnataka, remeber guys. Mallu criminal state. Know i will deleted ur app."
"Great content, and the app works well. Unfortunately, the greedy just get greedier. Due to the latest price increase, I'll be canceling my subscription."
"since the new update, all the 21:9 videos are stretched on my 21:9 Xperia 1 v. previously they fit perfectly because the videos and screen are same ratio, now for some reasons the 21:9 videos would have black bars on top and bottom of my 21:9 screen."
5 star worthy content. 1 or 2 star worthy price increases. It was like 8 or 9 dollars when I first got it. It is now twenty 4 dollars! The price increases feel quite scammy.
"It's nice and all, but every time I use fast forward, rewind, or skip to the next episode it kicks me and logs me out. I'm getting really tired of logging back in every time I use anything but the pause button :) so if y'all could fix that you'd get 5 stars. Please. Please fix it."
"Netflix is good, tho the problem is that they take away shows or movies, and I don't like it. I was watching a show and now it's gone that is something I don't like."
Stops working on my Roku devices often and I HATE using it on my phone now because of the games tab. My son hits it alllllll the time and I don't use it and would like to not see it!!
"I cant access it on my android. It used to work on it. But since last night i cannot access it, though it works on TV. I register di account on my phone and Tv"
I have a complaint that we were unable to pay for Netflix with a debit card. I hope they acknowledge and address this issue. I am looking forward to receiving a positive response.
It has the egghead arc of one piece but cut off at marine Ford and skipped all the way there like pls just get the other episodes in-between this makes it bad for people who haven't watched the series on a different platform
"You keep hiding the downloads from me, I wonder why. Overall I like the app, but come on e need the downloads and I don't see the option, it appears and disappears whenever..."
This app ised to be fantasitic and now it has so mamy glitches and bugs i dont even want to use it anymore. Ive pretty much replaced it with hulu because everytime i try to watch a movie it freezes or goes black or clicks me out of a movie right in the middlle of it. This app should be great for watching movies since it is a movie app but like i said...to many glitches!!!!! Please fix the issues ASAP. I want my original netflix back not the latest new and NOT improved version. Thank you
"Why did this app control the brightness of the display. Every TV show and movie is barely visible. Stop this, I like to put the display settings to my preferences"
"I've loved Netflix for years, the last 2 days I can't open it on my phone, I updated and still it won't open, it just goes to the Netflix blacka and red screen and stops there, any advice?"
"Netflix is good But the video is freezing, lagging, Voice and sound not match Please solve this issue... Thanks"
"Honestly it's a great app but sometimes it says me""you can't continue watching a lot of people are watching from my account"" like since when the only people who watch from my account is me and my sister and she isn't even watching Netflix currently"
"Recently the app keeps hanging, especially on phone, when you hit play on any movie, it shows it's loading and never plays."
"It's suddenly not working on my phone. Old shows I've watched will load, but nothing new that's come out. I don't have Internet but I've never needed it before."
"Major problem lately, where I keep getting skipped back sometimes an entire season of episodes. If I pause the show for any reason and come back, instead of playing where I left off, it will start playing an episode I already watched, sometimes even starting from ep 1 of the season. It's extremely annoying having to back out and find the episode I was actually on, then where I was during that episode. 3 stars until this is fixed."
"Keeps glitching! It always jums couple of seconds ahead without the possibility to rewind, so I keep missing from every episode or movie I'm watching not knowing what was said or what has happened. Not cool at all! Also sometimes the picture just freezes but audio keeps playing. For the money they charging one would think the streaming will be at least flawless."
It is a good app to watch movies but when I watch spider man into the spider verse I couldn't find because they delated it and spider man 3 that's just the anyoing part. But there is good movie still on there like Lego Ninjago but ya
"Every time Netflix tries to play its ads now, it closes the app on my devices. Super annoying."
"This app seriously needs to offer 4K UHD and 3D movies for VR Headsets. After all, VR offers a far superior movie experience than any TV!"
I love watching movies every day but I can't go and watch a movie if 2 people are on Netflix I hate when it does that so I'm giving u a 3 until u fix that but I love chilling the movies except I don't like when I can't watch my movies I love because it's only on my mom's account and I can't get in it till she opens it so if u want a better review then fix thing that need to be fix and I can't watch the new season of my movie too so fix it or I'll give u a zero or a one ‚õàÔ∏è‚õàÔ∏è‚õàÔ∏è‚õàÔ∏è‚õàÔ∏è‚õàÔ∏è‚õàÔ∏è‚õàÔ∏è‚õàÔ∏è‚õàÔ∏è‚õàÔ∏è‚õàÔ∏è
"Please update in extra membership. It's easy to cancel the extra membership. I hope before to cancel it, need verification code to email confirmation"
I think all movie or kdrama Netflix have but I'm wrong..so sad.so Many kdrama Netflix don't have even some people say on Netflix but when im search but can't find it. I'm pay for Netflix is not cheap also but I'm disappointed üòî
There isn't a lot of anime or horror movies but there are a few good movies.
This app has a pot of one piece movies but that one piece series isnt even complete yet the movies have main characters or new allies ive never seen before the movie just spoil the characters that arent even in the series yet i dont even know how luffy even met some of those character pls add more episodes then il change my review
"Ever since the very last update, i have had nothin but problems w/everything playin on my phone. It's always buffering, tryin to load, or just won't play at all. I've had Netflix for 3 years now. Never had a problem, until this last update. I've always paid for Netflix, kept this account for 3 years & my payments have always been on time & I've never missed one. Please fix super soon or I'm canceling my account w/ u & goin to Hulu. will give 5 stars when fixed."
would appreciate if you guys actually reccomended decent movies instead of the ones that have famous actors. half of this is copy pasted or the most boring thing ever (don't watch adventureland yall)
"I would love it if there is a playback speed configuration in the app, I already installed an extension on my browser, because for me a lot of the shows are unwatchable with the normal speed. Please Netflix, if you want me to use it on my phone, a playback speed button will be great üôè"
"Usually an awesome app but since a few weeks ago, Everytime I start or skip ahead anything I'm watching, the subtitles come on and I have to manually turn them off. Not other issues but would be nice if this could get resolved. I've done some reaserch and I can't seem to figure out how to turn them off perminately."
The minor changes in User Interface is the worst after November/December 2023 new update and encountering few bugs as well eg. screen freezes on home page etc. Fix it before you take my money again.
Netflix is super nice and awesome for the movie and the series but the other series is inadequate like the pokemon ultimate journey the series is no longer placed it. I hope you put season 3 of pok√©mon master journey please . For now you got a 3 star for me
Why does your app override brightness settings. The lowest setting is way too bright at night. Let. Me. Use. The. Settings. On. My. Own. Phone.
Works some of the time but will sometime go hours or days without working. I get no video playback during this time. Why should I pay for a service that only works some of the time?
5 stars if they did a yearly subscription for netflix tired of it always getting paused because i don't have 15 bucks in the bank each month rather just pay a year in 1 go instead and forget about that issue
app won't open. it's either i should close the app or wait. but waiting is meaningless because its only black screen and nothing else.
Please add an option to skip adult +18 content when watching movies which include that type of scenes.idont like to use child mode or hide 18+mode.it is very embarassing when that type of content play in front of inappropriate people.
It has some good things to watch but when I download it on my phone so I can watch different things in the same room it tells me I have 14 days and it's so annoying that I can't just have it on my phone without it logging me out
It doesn't say all of the shows or/and movies I watch like in the tv.I want Netflix to change that.
"I need to know if there is any chance of getting FHD content on my Huawei Y9 prime 2019? My phone has DRM L1, but netflix app recognize my phone as L3. This issue is very annoying üò§."
How can I stop Netflix from rejecting my calls when watching movies? Why is Netflix rejecting my incoming call? I won't even get notified until I close the app before I'll be seeing missed calls
"I love the app, no issues on playback or it logging me out on any devices that I use. However on my xbox the subtitles are only available in the white context but on my laptop I can choose yellow format I believe it's been a while. So when on the xbox when I watch anime or other subtitled shows/movies in white letters it sometimes disappears in the background"
Pretty mid. Gives a little then takes a lot. Streaming is good for the most part tho and they have some cool specials. Not sure where I sit on value
"I'd give a higher rating, however, it is very frustrating, aggravating, annoying to get some stupid pop-up asking if I'm still watching when I'm in the middle of watching a show/movie"
"I like Netflix, but they keep removing movies/shows, and it makes me sad cause I really like thoose movies/shows. Can you please bring back total drama seasons please?"
The app is not allowing me to select SD card as my download location. Other apps are using the SD card just fine.
I don't need this app on my phone because I am hearing impared and would have to turn closed caption on too and I never watch Netflix on here. I have it in my home. I've tried to take it off many times but it doesn't let me. When I finally got it off it came back on and updated every time I take it off. When there's no need for a app we should be able to make those choices and changes. Once it's off my phone I have no problem giving it 5 stars. Why have something that I absolutely can't use ?
I'm really disappointed that there is only one season of my favorite show on Netflix and that show is transformers prime I want to have all three seasons back on Netflix.
My app isn't giving me the option to cast to my projector screen. Very trusting it's updated to the latest version and everything
Very limited content no depth in geners. But excellent system hardly see any disturbance.
"Has weird video thingy at bottom, which is like...beyond annoying, and sometimes it takes forever to load. Not only on my account nor in my space, but even with friends at their place as well. The updates hit a high, they were really cool, then just got progressively worse and more annoying. Kinda sad, cus the updates were cool at first, but their just purely annoying now."
Ive been watching Netflix for years now but I would like to see an improvement on their user interface . They should make it more user friendly for the viewers. I use to like how we can actually rate the movies or TV shows we watched out of five stars. Now we can only leave a like. I would like to see ratings on the movies/Tv shows and see Netflix change its design as well
It was a great app I've been using it for many years after the last couple updates you have really created a lot of bugs first of all I don't understand why your casting option is covering movies secondly I find it extremely annoying that you no longer track the movies that I have watched you tell me that there's new episodes on TV shows that I've already watched you should have a watched list and you should also be able to remove titles off of your currently watching list like ones you are no longer interested in but now that I've mentioned that you no longer have the continue watching option seems as if Netflix is decreasing in the value it was once Worth to me I suppose once you're Marvel movies are gone I will be too unless you Rectify your problems
"I just have a recommendation that you should consider to make the app better as you improve it over time: Its a good idea to inform the users of Netflix what movies, shows, documentaries, etc. are being removed off of the app when they open the app, including a search bar if they feel you might have removed it. You could also just make a new column when looking at settings or whatever that says ""whats being removed"", when lookin at what's being removed, they should be told when to expect it."
"Wrote a review a few days back about being unable to download anything because I apparently have too much downloaded on other devises. Went through and checked, said other devises, and foubd some super old stuff that hadn't technically been deleted so I deleted them but AM STULL UNABLE TO DOWNLOAD ANYTHING! It's starting to tick me off and there is no good reason why, now especially, that I can't download a single, 20 minute episode of SOMETHING, be it on phone or laptop app!"
Pretty nice streaming service. But I would have given you guys an extra star if you stop releasing trilogy movies out of sequence. Rather not release at all.
"Netflix is constantly improving and updating their browsers. I am very satisfied with cost, data consumption and content. However custom service isn't helpful at all, especially the live chats. I do however dislike the idea that not all seasons and movies are available.There is an option of recommending shows and u never hear back to when or why the show will be available in ur country on Netflix. Netflix in Lebanon is being treated like a 3rd world leftover service not cool."
I would like that you do a better job with the suggestions (both in the app and the website version). I'm tired of getting suggested movies and series I've down-voted and also stuff I already have on my list. It's extremely annoying to see the same things popping up over and over again. If you manage to fix that I'll give 5 stars.
The contents are ok. My issue is seeing the same shows and tv again and again. I think there are a lot of contents available on the app. But hard to know unless you deliberately search for it. There should be a tab lile discover something new. where it will show different content daily or weekly.
"Compared to Prime Video by Amazon some key features are missing. No trailers, no horizontal view for menu, no vertical view for video, no in-scene actor info, few audio langue versions, skip show into absent or doesn't work, no one tap to pause. I'd also like to see IMDb ratings, swipe to rewind/fast forward. I don't like how much the show icons are changing."
"Great well-designed app only thing is there is not enough original content on Netflix, and after the last price hike I expected they would have much more original shows and movies but sadly that has not been the case. Netflix has increased the price now they need to improve the service. I'm getting bored"
"5 stars if they fix the terrible battery drain. Even if I force stop, it turns itself back on and destroys my battery life.  Update, I've spent hours on this.  I finally had to disable the app.  I'll enable it when I need to use it.  However, that is absurd.  Why not fix it.  Many, many people with this problem trying to find a fix on the Internet."
"The app freezes a lot when you pause a show and will not allow you to continue watching it without completely getting out of the app and going back in or sometimes restarting the device you were using. Also, it does not always keep your progress on shows and will put you back at the beginning when you go back to continue watching. If it weren't for those issues I would give it five stars."
"please can we have the old Netflix back, just give us a build from a couple months ago, so many playback errors for downloaded content and that Play something button is driving me nuts, can we please have an option to get rid of it? I'm pretty sure I asked that in my Netflix review on here which I can't see anymore. Netflix is my favourite streaming service and I really want to give it 5 stars, just things two things are killing it atm"
"Can't watch on my phone!! Audio plays over a black screen! Never had this issue until a few months back no matter what title I try to watch it gives me only a black screen while the audio plays I have updated, uninstalled it , reinstalled it, turn my phone off reset software defaults and followed Netflix's instructions for fixing this problem and all to no avail. Please fix"
"I love the app but it would be nice to have a search filter to exclude shows&movies without audio in your language. It's really annoying to find something you think you might like, click on it and play it to find out it only has Spanish or Chinese audio. Nobody watches 3 seasons of a tv show for entertainment in a language they don't understand. Reading subtitles isn't something people would do just for fun."
"Most people probably have this app installed by now. My only gripe is the layout. I wish they'd make it easier or more obvious to know when new shows or movies have been added on the day. As it stands, I'll find a movie or show has been added weeks after its arrived. They should give non-Netflix content the same attention and hype as their own stuff. Also, if you minimize the app to open something else and then return the subtitles (if you have them on) often disappear. You have to close app."
"Okay. Sometimes great content & sometimes it's so cluttered with unwatchable content that you'll spend hours sifting thru. BUT they have a lot of options. That being said, how about a language filter option?! That way, a user can choose which languages/countries they would like to see content from, and which they would not. Don't worry, there's still plenty of exposure to new and terrible things with his option, but it would.allow a user to have a much better experience overall. Filter the flood"
"Subtitles for many dialogues of dramas are NOT present in English. Currently, Im of episode 10 of drama 'whats wrong with secretary kim' and many English subtitles are missing and mixed up with each other !!!"
"Sometimes when I watch Netflix, the show on screen will freeze but the audio continues to play. It happened a few times already, I tried closing the app, clearing my storage and restart my phone but the problem still occurs. It's getting a little annoying and I hope you guys can help fix this issue. I'm using a Samsung phone btw thanks"
I'm not sure whether to give 3 or 4 stars. I don't know why some countries have access to certain movies/tv shows and some don't. I would love to see the button to mark something as already watched. 'Continue watching' feature is also glitched. I finished watching a movie and I can't remove it from continue watching feature. But overall I would still recommend using Netflix.
"Yesterday I asked you to fix the issue that when I click ""space"" on the keyboard of my laptop to pause the movie, it takes me back to the main page of the app. The issue is fixed now with the new update. However, another issue emerged. When I click ""space"" again to resume the movie (after the pause) it takes me again to the main page of the app. You partially fixed the issue. Can you please fix the whole issue please?"
"Chromecast integration of the Android app could really be better. In particular the ""skip intro"" feature sometimes only shows up after switching between different menus (e.g. home and downloads), as if it does not refresh state after screen wake. Poor implementation. I generally like the feature, though :)"
"Whenever I leave the app to come back, I have to sign in again and again. Sometimes, it says that it is an incorrect password even though it is"
"I like the app personally but the shows are getting boring. Most things on Netflix are good but overate. The took mean girls down and I stopped watching Netflix for some time. I have Netflix on another device but I feel like Netflix could do better with more movies, shows,ECT. Like the Grinch was there last year and the app usage went UP but not now it's pretty low anyways great app I guess üòÉ"
"No problems, except for an hour and a half long detour on the phone while Netflix had to look into why it wouldn't take my payment information. Then all of a sudden the app worked while I was still getting payment alerts. Super weird, pretty inconvenient. Customer Service was nice though. Thanks Nicole."
"Overall a great app, BUT got some glaring ux problems. It feels like the app downprioritises movies and tv-series more and more in favour for mobile games and short clips,. One annoying feature is that the buttons to show either only movies or series is shown only when on top of the home screen, why not when you're halfway down or when you've searched for something?"
"Issues with download playback on Chromebook - the app seems to work ok but on playing offline, downloads randomly stop playing with an error to ""try again"". Multiple errors on longer downloads. Clicking OK kicks you back to the download page. You could overcome it by skipping over the section that causes the issue since it would always stop at the same time stamp but this isn't a great experience and when you start the playback again it starts from the start not where it got to."
"This app works really well and doesn't crash, however, I find it very frustrating that I cannot search and find what I'm looking for as well as I would like. For example, I would like to have a kind of sub category within a genre such as [docuseries > realityTV > houses] for shows about home repairs...I would also like to search by subject, such as westerns or cars, and not just by title, and also alphabetically so that I would know I was getting access to everything available."
"Before this review would have been a hands down without a doubt 5 stars, but after the last dang update, anything that I watch period will start out with you hearing sound but all you will honestly see is a black screen, or it will start with both sound and video, and then the sound continue playing but the video has frozen. This makes the 6th time that I have had to uninstall and reinstall just to fix the issue and considering the fact that I pay for it, Im not gonna keep doing that."
App is not working samsung s24 ultra please fix
"Convenient and easy to navigate. Could stop with all that nonsense of trying to stop people from sharing passwords that's for sure though! Like get over yourselves, I'm pretty confident in saying I'm sure Netflix CEO(s) are definitely NOT struggling in their lives financially. Get over yourselves, honestly."
Good collection of movie but they are ignored kannada options in categories option all languages are there but not kannada is there it shows negligence of language
I like that Netflix is got an array of movies and seasons but they are not up to date in the current seasons of shows like everyone else. It would also be nice if we could have local live channels based on out zip code and an option to add some movie channels to our package. A cinema with movies in theaters be nice also. I like Amazon prime better. At least HBO comes with it. I do like the array of seasons like Supergirl and DC Legends ect though just wished they was current with seasons.
"after my account logged out from app, I'm not able to login, it's said that my email or password is incorrect, obviously there is another reason, because I successfully login with this creds on web sites. Maybe something wrong with my location (Turkey), but everything was working, until it logged out. It could be great to know the right reason why it's happening."
"The app is great and all but the way switching to the dialogue audio language affects the whole entire series. Like for example from switching the audio to English to Japanese in one series and then as soon as I exited and jumped into a different show, everything else is affected. I even tried switching it back to English audio but it's still stuck with the same language."
"Personally, I haven't had an overload of problems with the app itself. This could be because I rarely watch it enough to notice anything. I have noticed that throughout the show/movie, it will freeze the screen but continue to play audio (I encountered this a few times today.) The constant taking shows/movies off, and then adding them back is nerve racking."
"The app on mobile is fine, only complaint I have is that the skip buttons (I.e 10s forward/back) don't skip 10 seconds, sometimes it's like 5 seconds, sometimes it's more than 30. It's plain bad. But the reason for 3 instead of 4 stars is the desktop version. The full screen rarely works, there are lots of missing features, and I belive a company as big as netflix shouldn't have an issue fixing those simple design problems."
It's pretty good just that I discovered I was charged twice at my first subscription which was two days ago that's on the 6/01/2024 can u people refund back my money or are you taking it for the next month subscription
I pay 9$ a month mostly for my daughter. I see the same selection of shows and movies with maybe 1 different in like 3 -4 rows in sequence so theres really not a variety of anything and every movie i typed in has not been available. Not even the 1st frozen. Im actually fed up with paying this amount for 1 screen to be allowed at a time and no selections to choose from. I get more free online. I get texts and etc saying netflix wants to give you this or that. All fake scams.
"The app dims my brightness and I cant get it to be bright enough to see the movies. I tried getting to the app permissions, but their is nothing there to fix it. It doesn't do this on my TV only on my phone. Unfortunately, my TV isn't set up right now so I have no way of being able to enjoy watching Netflix. Im switching to Hulu until the problem can be fixed on my phone."
"Not the best as you can consider. The subtitbles are wrong and are using inadecvate words, sometimes even trivial words, the screen time is so short that sometimes you don't even notice the subtitles and moreover, some movies do not have subtitles in my language. After 1 month and half of usage I declare myself unsatified by Netflix services. LE: after each update the movies downloaded locally won't play anymore. Are you serious Netflix team? Was the main advantage over other simialar service"
"I have been with you what seems like forever. I'm not even complaining about the price hike. What i'm having a problem with is shows loading very slow or not at all. Being told unable to play this tittle right now. Not EVEN loading! I upgraded to the highest internet speed available, nope no difference. Fix whatever your problem is, we are losing interest when you can't watch, why keep?"
"Many interesting movies are not added, iCarly, The Originals, star and many more"
"Everything else is perfect apart from the fact that it drains a lot of battery. One full charge on my phone gives me more than six hours of 1080p videos in full screen mode in YouTube, while Netflix barely touches the 4 hours mark. There is some serious room for improvement."
"There are problems with it that really upset me. If it was free then I wouldn't have a problem with it. For example a lot of movies are region locked, so you have to have a good vpn if you want to watch good movies. Also the downloads have some problems. They expire after 2 days, forcing you to go online and verify them. There is a limit to how much you can download. The error codes are there only for jokes. You google it and netflix just says restart your android device."
"Increase in monthly subscription. Used to be like 11.99, now its $25.00. Don't like it that much to continue to pay their stupid continuous fee increases..."
"The app is not working. I was watching a video and It stop playing it. Besides that, any movie is loading. I force stop the app and reboot my phone and it does not work at all. I even reset my Wi-Fi network and it is still the same. I can get access to all my app and can reproduce any video but your app is having a issue running at the moment. Please fix it. We are paying for your service."
"Resume video when minimize Netflix app. When I minimize my Netflix app then I open another app, Netflix app suddenly playing the video by itself. Sometimes I don't realize that it plays the video by itself. And I lost some part of the videos when I watch it later. Please fix it!!! Annoys me a lot"
Yous do updates but don't tell us what you are updating. All yous say making experience even better. I have had Netflix for long time and it's gone to the dumps and the price keeps going up but the shows and movies have gone down play the same s#√ót. Needs to update the movie selection and there TV into better shows and more reality show.
Having a separate brightness from my phone settings is ruining the app for me. The autobrightness setting on my phone gets extremely bright when in the sun but won't work when using Netflix. Even if I'm inside during the daytime sometimes I still can't see the video well with your brightness setting turned up. Please get rid of your separate brightness feature or at least have the option to turn it off for the people that don't like it.
"Need to figure out a less time consuming way to delete stuff from the continue watching list. It can't be that hard to do since HULU makes it very easy. One click. The show is not on your continuing watching list and if you decide to add the show back, your progress is still there to tell you the episodes you've watched already. I'm tired of having to go on some long af journey to delete ALL the the episodes i've watched. Disney shows are disappearing, don't give me another reason to switch. D+"
"Can't see full ""my list"" using options. Ex: 1 my list 2 TV 3 sort A-Z ‚û°Ô∏è Results stop at ""D"" All combinations of categories/sort options have same issue. (This'll be a GREAT feature when fixed.) The red circular icon at the bottom does nothing. Please fix this. There are SO many things I want to watch, but I need to scroll through do decide what I'm in the mood for."
"I had no complaints until I started getting an error message that makes the app unusable. It tells me to restart my device and try again. I have done that. I have uninstalled the updates and installed them again. Still can't use it. I'm sure it would be fine if I could uninstall it, restart my phone, then reinstall it. Unfortunately, I have a samsung device, which makes it impossible to uninstall. I'm only allowed to disable it apparently. So I'm left with an app that I can't use."
"The UI on mobile is good. The web based UI sucks. I'm just trying to scroll down and every damn selection balloons up and fuchs everything up. I don't need auto expanding previews. Concerning content netflix is lacking. There have been some amazing series and originals, but IMO (this means opinion, not fact) there is too much sex and homosexuality. Not that it's there, it's just so blatant and over the top. Representation matters, but netflix's blitzkrieg on inclusion is a bit tactless."
"I don't like that this app takes exlusive control of the brightness when in use. I like to multitask and watch in the 'Picture in Picture' mode. Browsing the web, checking emails, etc. Sometimes the brightness of apps varys wildly, and to change the brightness, I have to go back to Netflix's fullscreen view and change the built in brightness setting. I get that this is supposed to be a convenience feature, but it is actively inconvenient at times. An option to disable it would be nice."
Netflix app is okay overall only big complaint is content and shows too many series canceled after one season or two seasons after people invest into watching them all which ends up being a complete waste of time. Netflix needs to produce shows that can be produced for several seasons in a row instead of one and done. Also for being an America I'm seeing way too many foreign movies and foreign shows that I have no interest in and less and less domestic titles
"It would be nice if I wasn't forced to watch previews when I want to watch the credits just incase there is something at the end or if it's interesting enough to sit through, I hate there is no watch credits option like it is usually on my TV Netflix version, idk how different it is from the mobile app but it's apparent I can't watch the credits here, I'll feel better if there were to be a setting to set off auto previews, as I seriously find it ridiculously annoying, thank you if you consider."
"I consistently have issues with this app remembering the last episode I was on. This has been an issue for years but has definitely worsened in the last year. Every time I open and press play on my current series, it takes me to a previous episode in a random spot and then I have to try and figure out which episode I was on and where I was at. Super annoying. If I can find the same series on a different service, I usually try to watch it there first before settling for Netflix phone app."
i love watching netflix but when i connect it to my tv using hdmi wgen i open a movie it instantly go black only subtitles
"While Netflix often offers a large variety of shows in premium quality, lately I've been finding the quality quite questionable, more so with the newer released shows. Things such as audio delay and glitches can be expected. I also have a problem with the shows and movies they provide, although there is quite a few, the order in which they do it defies logic, for example having the second and the third movie, but not the first. Despite this, watching is relatively easy and fun for everyone."
"Picture in Picture mode doesn't work on Redmi Note 11s. Tried all solutions available online, contacted support but they just told me to reinstall and restart my phone, which doesn't work. And I'm pretty sure it's the issue with the app and not my phone, because the PiP for YouTube and other apps on this phone work perfectly fine. OS is MiUI 13.0.7."
"I am enjoying Netflix and the shows available. However, the app and account security is somehow low. Please allow 2FA as an option, I have experienced unknown logins using my account and it is a lot of work logging off all my devices, changing password, and log in on them again. Or an option to remove specific devices that you don't know."
"Great content. It is probably the media provider that I use the most but &I don't know if it's my tablet but it shouldn't be, I've got a Lenovo tab 3+ which is still pretty decent, the app is still slow to respond it takes 3-5 minutes to boot up. Then every time you scroll you have to wait a few more minutes for it to catch-up. Once you're watching something is fine it's just when your trying to find something to watch that sucks. But as we all know Netflix is great."
No doubt that netflix is one of the best ott platform and what it gives us at what price ( 99 ) is just above the line. But i am giving it three star because i am also a gta lover and not able to download the gta games which netflix provides. It says that my phone is not compatible although i am having android 13 and it requires android 11 only. So netflix fix this and its a 5 star from me.
Decent selection but it's not the netflix of yesteryear where there is a wide variety of content from lots of sources. A bunch of original content which is pretty good with some older and newer content. Just not a as huge selection which is disappointing. Plus they change the selection frequently. One day I'll stop watching a show to come back the following weekend to find it's been removed. Almost like it's foundation is now to be binge watched then update for the next binge.
"I mean, its Netflix. The streaming platform itself is iconic but I have a few issues with it. For starters, the anime options for americans. Its inconvenient to have to find a VPN just so can watch some anime, and also netflix almost never finished getting all the episodes for an anime, for example, hunter x hunters final seasons are completely missing. Another issue is the app itself. The app is constantly crashing. And today it logged out of my acc. :/"
"The app doesn't give you all the personalization choices it should. Had to log on via browser, which is tough when the app keeps loading!, to opt out of the annoying and unwanted ads between episodes. I pay for this. I don't want the ads. Hulu and Amazon looking better all the time."
"App interface is smooth but my main concern is that every time I start watching a new show or movie, it will disappear from the mobile app. So, I don't actually get to use the mobile app for what it is meant. This has happened with three different shows for sure. All the shows still show up on the TV app and even on my Google displays. So, the problem must be with my mobile app. Unistalling does nothing."
"Netflix is a great app. But there is a problem for me. Netflix doesn't have any popular movies. I mean they should add more movies. Korean actor, Ma dong-seok movies are not available on Netflix. Only 2-3 movies of this actor are available. I really think Netflix should add more movies."
"Like the content. Absolutely hate that the volume is not uniform! Always louder over songs and in scenes with heavy background music, have to keep adjusting the volume for those vs scenes with dialogues."
They finally got it so the player will reduce when using other apps but they still haven't fixed the subtitles issue of them returning each episode. If they don't fix this issue I'll be getting a cheaper account because there is no point in having it for my phone if the subtitles keep popping up.
I've had Netflix for ages but I've notice more and more of the removal of some of the best and most popular searches while leaving a lot of the very least. While there is no shortage of variety. It's just -very disappointing- to find the best shows and movies gone especially when ‚û°Ô∏è Netflix hikes up their prices on a -regular- basis. ‚òπÔ∏è
"While they have good shows and all its becoming more of a money making thing for them. Now on top of what I already pay for their service plus tax, they are implementing a state tax for Florida (Only). Which will add an additional charge to what I'm being charged."
"Simple changes could be made throughout the app to greatly improve experience. For instance the complicated constant renewing of downloads to be able to view video on the go, and if you forget then you're screwed and left with a screaming toddler."
Everything's great except the fact that 90% of the movies/shows I get recommendations for aren't available in India but there it is on Netflix of another European country. Not sure what the discrimination is for. Forces people's hand into using pirate sites.
"Subtitles don't work properly with Chromecast. The timing is erratic - they sometimes are delayed, and sometimes disappear far too quickly. Not all the time, but often enough for it to be annoying. So will go back to using my laptop to watch shows with subs."
It is a good app but there Is one problem. It lags a lot and takes a long time just to load the whole app.
"I'll start by saying this √ó3 star review has nothing to do with Netflix as a streaming platform. Nor do I have any complaints as to how the service is set up both mobile|desktop. The issue I have is with the updates. I currently run the new S21 5G Ultra. The notifications have increased over the past 72hrs. As of now it reads ""unable to resume update, waiting for stable wifi network"" I have two issues with that. 1.) Router is at 760Mps and 2.) Netflix says it's up to date ‚Äîso what's the jist..?"
"A Series i am watching is too dark, your light adjustment feature has limited adjustment. Can you make it so it can be adjusted higher so that viewing is much more pleasant. Thank You. 5 stars are waiting to appear for youüòéüëç‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê..."
"I've been using the app for a long time and while I love the HQ, there have been and still are many glitches that have no clear fix (or any at all, in many cases) and there isn't any obvious way to report these kinds of bugs in-app. The help section provides absolutely no help for most of the issues I've been having. I've been finding myself on old q&a threads just trying to get answers as to what the hell is wrong with my phone. As a streaming service, I love Netflix. As an app, it needs work."
Awesome App but I'm seriously annoyed that theres a cap on downloading shows/movies?? I full time RV so half the time I'm in an area with zero reception. So I may cancel my membership since I cant use it to it's full capability. That's the only reason for the 2 missing stars. It's not like you get to keep the downloads as they expire after a certain time.
"Can y'all bring back the option of deleting series/movies from ""Continue watching?"" Some of them are trash and the only way it can be removed is by watching the entire thing. I don't want to be subjected to watching hours of trash. Also, it would be nice to see some correspodance from you in relation to the problems that myself and the other users are experiencing. People hate to waste their money, especially when they can stream for free."
It would be nice to have the option to download audio only files (smaller downloads) or the option to switch from video to audio only when playing so it doesn't drain your battery as much. It should also allow u to switch to different apps or turn the screen off without the audio playback stopping. It also needs a sleep timer.
"The update kinda screwed some things up. When I'm scrolling through the titles, only a few show up while the rest appear to be buffering/loading. I tried looking at my connection to make sure it's not my wifi, and that wasn't the problem. For some reason, this only happens on the mobile version and not my TV, laptop, or PS5. Plz fiz this as it has been going on for a while now."
"The app and Netfix in general work just fine. Never had any service issues. My problem is that it's just the same stuff over and over again. Yeah they add things, but rarely do they add anything really good. I like quite a lot of the Netflix originals, but no point in getting invested because they all get cancelled in 1-3 seasons. Anything not cancelled takes a year before getting a couple new episodes. The more well known shows I watch are the same things I watched a year ago. So boring now."
"I have a problem with updating the app. After starting the app, loading screen pops up and after a while I get a screen msg wanting me to update the app. After I close this window it gets my playstore opened and there is no option to update the app. So I have to reinstall it, once closed after use, I get the same problem. Would appreciate some help."
Streaming is usually fast. Content is fairly good if not way more left leaning than not. One thing that really bothers me is that it keeps propagating the app onto my screen. I keep everything in folders to keep an orderly screen but this one keeps adding itself again and again outside of the folder... really annoying!
"As a subscription streaming service, Netflix is okay, but seeing as I use this app to watch stuff it's unbelievable that I'm paying ¬£10 a month to just get the 5.10 error all the time, I have to do so much to just watch stuff and I don't have these issues with any other streaming service - including cheaper or even free ones. Please sort this out, not being able to use the service I pay for does lean me towards cancelling, especially seeing as I can't use the web version on my phone."
App is good but Content are not Hd provided. I am basic HD customer but content picture quality are very poor. Please provide HD quality picture in content.
"Great streaming service with lots of content. But there prices are getting out of hand if compared to prime, disney, apple TV and many other. They charge for more if you want HD and even more if you want 4k others all include this. I wish the only thing they charged extra for was more screens. Regardless I'll keep my standard package for now if the prices go up again without improved service or picture quality. I will be cancelling my subscription."
"I love Netflix, I pay for 3 streaming services and this by far the best. The best UI, the best for forwarding/rewinding, the best for suggestions. But I cannot fathom why or how their mobile app is soo superior to the smart TV version. No genre option outside of search and no preview on search?? So you get a bunch on continue watching on stuff you have no interest in. Prime outdoes it by putting IMDB ratings...sort it out Netflix"
The selection is kind of good but the UX is bad. I want to filter the search results better as well as my list because there are too many things on my list and it looks overwhelming. What if I just like romcoms today? Mystery tomorrow? It's a bit hard to tell which is which with the list. Add filters. Can we also have custom lists in the future?
"Great app, Great concept from when they started with DVD's in the mail killing Blockbuster! I hope you guys don't go the way of cable with your prices as a new increase is coming soon. I'd hate to have to cancel my subscription. Been a member since 2000! Hopefully you stay Netflix and won't be bought by Amazon!"
It would be nice if the main menu could rotate from portrait to landscape in the mobile app. I find it difficult to navigate after my phone is already sideways sitting on a charging stand for viewing. It would also be nice if you could remove a show from the continue watching list of you do not wish to keep watching it.
"Netflix is great. Helped me get caught up on a lot of movies and series I couldn't watch when they released due to a busy work schedule. However I'm a tad annoyed that despite having a very capable phone with the right settings and updates, picture and picture mode which is a feature I value very very much is broken. YouTube similarly has this feature and it works how it should on my current device, the ZTE Axon M running Oreo 8.1. Please fix this issue, so the rest of us can enjoy Netflix more."
"Why can't you let us go? After i while i thought that Netflix is not worth the money and cancelled my subscription. There is a ton of explanation for how to do that, accompanied by ""how to renew"". But there is just one explanation for uninstalling, and it does not work. I just want to get rid of it, but it doesn't let go. You need to disable the app, force stop it, find it in google play and disable auto-updates to prevent it from resurrection. But you can't uninstall it, simply can't."
"Netflix app for android at the moment is a bit clunky. I find myself a bit baffled whenever I was watching a video from the app intending to go back to the Netflix menu by pressing the back arrow button on the video but it just somehow exit the app for me and show me the android home screen. One other thing is, Netflix app got this brightness bar that you can adjust however you like but it doesn't show you the value of the bar, I just want to reset the brightness to default value but I can't."
"It's decent enough for using Netflix. Some problems with stuttering when using wireless earbuds. And sometimes even without them. Using a Note 10+. Wish there were more options for certain features. Also hate the addition of a brightness meter separate from my system settings. Who asked for that, really??"
I'm getting fed up with Netflix! 1st off they start raising their Prices! And then they're telling me Netflix is being used on too many devices! And if I want more devices to be able to watch Netflix I have to pay more! I know that Netflix is in a bad state right now. But this is way too much. I've been trying to watch whatever I can on Netflix to help them out What their financial situation. But at this point I'm ready to start watching naruto on hulu. Its a 3 star for now.
PLEASE BRING BACK THE OFFICE. So many of the shows and movies I loved Netflix for aren't there anymore. Hulu has a WAY better library. The only shows I watch on Netflix sometimes are Big Mouth and Trailer Park Boys but that's only sometimes considering I've watched all of the episodes of both of those shoes multiple times. The Office needs to be brought back along with a shitload of other shows. :(
"The 'can't play downloaded videos' after re-start/off-on hp is resolved on 08/08, after more than 2-3 months! The whole issue started around June. Called their Cust Svc on 23/06. After following their advice/steps, still unresolved. Netflix need to be more responsive/turn around faster given that it's paid subscription service. Any explanation/transparency to address the issue to customers will be highly appreciated. If complacency continues, will unsubscribe soon."
"Account was closed, but Netflix charged my account eventhough I stopped my subscription they used my debit card number without my permission causing an overdraft to my bank account! They aren't very security minded or trustworthy as they once were in the past! They would've never allowed that to happen, in the past before they got big!! Never giving them my information, again!!!!"
I can't read some of the subtitles because it's color white and if the background or the scenery is light colored you can't see the subtitles you'll have to test what they're saying. Netflix put at least black lines on each letter of the subtitles so we can read it!! We are paying for subscription and we can't even understand what we are watching!
"Im using Switch Smart TV and using Netflix to different account, Netflix im experience now is have Mouse control using TV remote and Netflix videos cannot move to left when i tried to choose another video. When playing video also i cannot pause and its very annoying. Please do maintenance for compatibility issues. Thanks"
"Netflix is this app where you have to pay for something. Unless you never had netflix and you want to watch ALL the films then J recommend it. From what I know is that everyone is saying that the price of an account is ridiculous of how bad the quality and shortage of movies. If you think about it. This application has 1 Billion downloads, it should have enough to make 75 programs on TV even, so I don't know why there is a shortage of films apparently."
"This past 4 or 5 days I literally can't play anything. I thought there was an issue with my network but turned out the wifi or my data cellular were absolutely fine. The screen went black with ""Loading..."" on every title I click. I tried rebooting the phone, rebooting the wifi router, reinstall, sign out-sign in; still can't play anything. Didn't share account to others. Went to live chat with CS but still no way out. Sorry but I have to unsubscribe. Will be back subscribing maybe months later."
Personally Netflix has always been great for me along from the few little bugs it's been really good but I stopped using it for a while and all of a sudden it won't open at first I just thought it was my wifi and forgot about for a few more days but then I came back and the same thing happened so I tried deleteling it and downloading it again but I can't delete it unless I update it so I tried updating it but it won't update and when I press open or tap on the app it just sits there a while 1/2)
"Cast button not showing up anymore (but it does on Prime video, so the issue isn't on my end)."
"I give Netflix a threestar review, only because of the advertisements coming up, and the act that in a week, we can't even watch out of the house. Other than that,Netflix is a great streaming service, what with the multitude of movies and shows, and the fact that they make their own movies and shows is absolutely awesome. I would recommend it to everyone."
"See me personally, I absolutely love Netflix, and I never had problems with it! BUT IM HEARING THAT YALL GOING TO HAVE ADS! Let me tell you, if you have ads, I'm not even going to want to hear the word Netflix for the next month or 2! Then I'm canceling any subscription! I'm obviously kidding but seriously I will be mad, like furious I'm serious, I would rate it 5 stars but I have seen a lot of critical reviews, so that's why, but that's all I wanted to state to the public, thanks Netflix!"
"After the most recent update on Feb 2, 2022 (8.16.0 build 6 40141) the app continues to give the following error... 'Please make sure that your device has network connectivity and the Date and Time settings are accurate. (-121)' I have uninstalled and found an older version apk build 8.15.0 and installed. Netflix now works fine. The current build needs to be fixed!"
"There's an error measage in Netflix when I try opening app from the Netflix widget. It says,""Sorry we could not reach the Netflix service. Please try again later (-1023) Internet connection is blazing fast in my wifi and it only happens when I open Netflix through its widget. The only fix I know and tried is rebooting my smartphone. Phone is Realme XT, Android 10. ****"
"Usually good but not tonight because I tried to open the app on my phone and I got a message saying ""Netflix says ""Sorry we could not reach the Netflix service. (-420)""."". Apparently it means your server is down for maintenance. Shame Netflix can't send out an email to subscribers saying that the server is down. Also why doesn't Netflix realise that the phone I sometimes use to view Netflix is always the phone I use to view Netflix?"
"The app works fine, it's good in all aspects, except that after I've been watching for a while the picture starts to get really juddery. I've tried using the app, clearing the cache/data, clearing memory on my phone, removing any data/wifi limits, removing battery- saving features... nothing seems to fix this problem. I'm not sure if it's my phone or the app but either way the viewing experience is spoiled."
"the S9+ version really needs fixing. constant crashing. the picture is either too small or cropped on the screen because it curves and most days its just a black screen, freezes and refuses to work even after uninstalling, cleaning cache data, the lot. Even when the video works, its so dark you can barely see it, even with brightness on max. i really love Netflix but i cant enjoy it on my phone. üò´"
"The app is so unreliable now. What's the point of being able to download episodes and movies but not being able to watch it?!? Just downloaded some new episodes last night but can't watch because of the errors that are generated. That's how I use this app. I'd i can't use it line that, I may as well cancel the service and sign up with someone else. Not impressed with it at the moment!! Pity because i used to love the app...üò† Gone from 5 stars to 3 stars."
"I've had this app for some years and its starting to malfunction, when I want to add something in my list it won't let me like it shows the little ‚úî but then it goes back to this ‚ûï and it's really annoying because first of when a show that I like won't appear sometimes unless I search it up but I have bad memory so also it just won't let me add shows and movies and its annoying. The second reason is that when I'm in episode 10 it either back or forward and that's really pissing me off."
"The app runs smoothly and I have not run into and functional issues. However, the app seriously need to be modified to alow split screen watching so I can use it whilst using other apps otherwise I have to use 2 devices which is frustrating. Another issue is that with certain programmes that are in English, when the odd character speaks in another language it would be great for the English subtitles to come up automatically instead of having to manually turn them on and off again for a sentence."
How come Netflix doesn't have any of the motion picture live action TRANSFORMERS movies (all of them) on their streaming platform I'm a huge fan of these movies and I've had Netflix for 3 yrs now and NEVER seen any transformers movies on here. It's a disappointment so for that Netflix gets 3 stars note to Netflix I've seen pretty much everything in your data base need more updates On movies instead we get one new/old movie a day and the rest is garbage. I might just cancel my subscription
"Generally it's ok. Good titles. I have Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus with great, vivid and bright screen. However, I've noticed that it's hard to watch dark scenes or movies (like Dark or the OA): it's too dark, lack of brightness and sometimes even it looks like the quality is not that good. To add, the app somehow changes color scheme to a less vivid (I can tell it when Netflix is in a picture mode and if I close it, I definitely see that colors are back to vivid - but why change? Let me decide"
You can watch a lot of movies and shows but I don't like when you add and take away some of my favorite movies the the Grinch realism my favorite Christmas movie
"The quality has dropped ALOT back in 2018 Netflix had all movies and they wouldn't take them down after like a month or two , seriously there is nothing on here when you wanna watch it , I see a movie that's old one day and the other day it was gone and it was added recently it's just that I bought the subscription a long time ago and It has been auto renewing it , I have seen how Netflix has dropped its quality after become one of the most famous media platform"
Keeps telling my husband to fix the household devices but won't tell him how and since when does NETFLIX HAVE ADS!?!!!!!????
Outstanding App! Has a lot of shows in one app. My problem is it keeps getting blury and the sound of the show I'm watching stops and then comes back stops and then come back on my TV. It gets really annoying also it takes a very long time to load. It also does the same thing on my phone. I've checked my internet multiple times and the internet's not the problem it's the app. Please fix this problem or I'll just uninstall the app.
"They would have 5 stars however it seems as of late everything that is ""popular on Netflix"" or recommended to me is not in English or even worse voice over.... Netflix needs to do something to create a filtering option.... Literally my husband and I have been sitting here for 40 mins browsing shows and EVERYTHING that seemed interesting to us so far hasn't been in English.... It's getting to a point where they r not putting enough options out there that I just might drop my acct......"
"Started having a problem where subtitles are automatically on so I have to turn them off every time I watch something. As well as this the app automatically closes the film or episode I'm watching, around 10 times in one film. Every time this happens i have to tap back on the film and turn subtitles off again."
"every time i want to resume any film, it wont get back to where i was exactly left it off, seems like it doesn't refresh every time i left it paused. for example, I've watch a series at 6th episode but the next time i tried to resume it, the episode wasn't updating to where it should've been. its like backskipping few episodes depends on how many episodes I've watch when i open netflix."
"As someone who requires to use subtitles the fact that any white background makes the white subtitles blend right in, has become a issue with multiple shows that i just can't watch due to there being essentially no subtitles cause i can't change the color. Also they took multiple wonderful shows away, I'm sure there's a legal agreement reason but either way still takes away from the value of Netflix."
"I love it! The unlimited access of shows the whole family can enjoy the only problem I have is that it keep freezing and glitching and the anime's that i watch dont have sub and i tried to access the captions but to no avail and it keeps closing,if it wasn't for these I would give 5 stars. It needs to be worked on properly can't recommend to friends with the problems I'm facing now."
Since my phone has done an update on the app it hasn't been the same cause I'm watching a show and I'm randomly logged off from it and it gets annoying. Plus they don't give out the entire seasons. There's some anime on there that only have 1-3 seasons when they contain way more than just 1-3 seasons like if the anime is there at least put up every season that it contains.
"Minus 2 stars because of the lighting update. It has become very annoying when I try to change the dimness settings, and can't do so until select something to watch. Half the time I can't even see what I've selected, I just want to fix the freaking brightness level. Please put it back the way it was, this update has been so very unnecessary, and more problematic than helpful."
I've change my password for mine and my husbands Netflix account and it won't let me log into my app at all or the Internet site version either.. Not happy all it keeps saying on the website is.. We having technical issues at the moment we trying to fix it please try again in a moment and on the app it just says that it's an invalid email or password when it's not. We have been having many issues with netflix lately I'm getting sick of it.. Get it fixed
Good app though my storage is low not like before ... I can't download as many movies or series as I want to unlike when I first installed the app. At times I rewind the video n it freezes living the audio playing n then when i try to forward the entire thing just stops and affects all my downloads . I even thought my phone was hanging but it occured severally . When I tried to clear the app's cache it had no impact.
"The only issue I have with Netflix is that movies and shows start up withthe descriptive audio and I have to go in and change it every time I start a show. It's very annoying. Please fix this where shows start in English or English 5.0, and if someone wants desceiptive audio they can choose that option. Thank you."
"The movies are great. But problem is, the movies i downloaded cannot be played. It's a waste of internet data. I downloaded movies so that I can watch inside our house, then it says, There is a problem playing the video. Please try again. (2.119). What a bummer. If I clear the storage, it would mean the movies I downloaded will be gone. Fix it please. I even updated the latest version of the app."
"Have been using this app on Nexus 6 device to access my Netflix account for years without any major issues.  Finally retired the Nexus 6 after 4 years and moved to Pixel 3.  Now unable to connect/log-in on new device.  Enter name/password and app just idles without connecting.  Cleared app storage, cleared app cache, uninstalled/reinstalled app, powered phone off, sacrificed a chicken, nothing has resolved the failure.  Hopefully this issue will be addressed shortly...."
"This app occasionally exits itself throughout the past one year on my Samsung tab s4. The final issue came when the app encountered an error while I was watching halfway. Unable to restart app and ended up reinstalling, where the Netflix wording froze on the screen after startup. Edit: now it's working after few reinstall attempts.. hope it works properly.."
"Can we please make that number hovering over the new and hot button go away after the first time clicking it? It's obnoxious and there's no clear way of getting rid of it. Stop trying to make new features a thing, Netflix. They're practically being forced on us when they really don't need to be. Make new features, it's cool. Stop pushing them on us."
"I really liked the app for the coming soon feature, but since it's been changed it's basically useless. I'm just being told that netflix has stranger things over and over with the odd bojack horseman, maybe oitnb, or any other (already OUT) netflix original. And recently added doesnt include everything and has things added a month ago but not stuff that came out yesterday. If I got to scroll netflix for 30 mins to find something to watch, I may as well watch YouTube"
There is no experience. I cannot get this app on my tv
"Mostly great and I enjoy my shows however recently the app on my phone keeps refusing to connect and it IS only with this app, also when it does eventually connect it will freeze several minutes in and will buffer for a long while until I either get fed up and decide to do something else or it looses connection yet again. NETFLIX PLEASE FIX THIS"
"It's an ok streaming service but it when I first signed up, its selection was duller than I expected. Don't get me wrong there's Good stuff but there's also a bunch of stuff that's kinda forgettable and stuff that's so trash that I can't fathom why they put that there. One example, there was an old Mexican wrestling show which was basically a copy of wwe except much more cringy. Thank goodness it's gone. Overall, Good for a free month. Not sure about a paid subscription though. Personally, Hulu seems to be better than Netflix nowadays."
"Love Netflix and all the content the provide, but it's almost completely unwatchable on my devices because of how dim the screen is. My phone and my TV both have OLED screens, and shows are just so dark that I can barely see what I'm watching. I wish they would give you a way to disable the HDR settings in the app until technology can actually catch up."
"Usually would rate it a 5 but the last update messed up the whole app. There's no lis t of my shows to continue to watch and when I went to one show it hadn't saved my place in the show like it has ALWAYS done. And when I go to click on my list, the app takes me out to the home screen instead of taking me to my list? If we could fix these kinds of issues it'd be much appreciated."
"Terribly working on my oneplus 9 pro during last week. Please fix this. Some posters do not upload properly. An error is shown when pausing the video (have to open the video again). Sometimes doesn't upload the page at all after choosing a profile on ""who is watching"" page. Also be informed that update can not be installed (constant 99% progress bar)"
"I don't understand why it's so difficult for these streaming apps to preserve and display watched progress properly. Netflix constantly resets progress on random episodes. Just add a ""mark as warched"" option already like the good video managers out there do. It is so frustrating always having to figure out where you left off last time."
"Enjoyable and more than worth the money. I have recurring problems where it says I have too many downloaded videos even if I only have one or two episodes downloaded and I have ample space on my tablet and SD card. I then have to erase cache or Uninstall updates and then reinstall, but it erases shows already downloaded and several times it has told me I have reached a download limit for that episode when I haven't even been able to watch it once. I primarily watch downloaded content."
Dislike the brightness bar in app as it disables the brightness bar on my phone. Consistently goes into this slowmo play and I'm forced to close and reopen app completely to fix it. I cant watch on a laptop without a NSES 500 error. Most shows I like to watch have had english dubbing removed and only subtitles are allowed. And it's now removed the continue watching section with a duplicate recommended to watch tv shows that are identical to the tv show section!
Before netflix was great... I can watch all movies I want but when I reformat my phone I can't even open the app and always can't reach the netflix service. I already did the uninstall install thing and the clear data part. I already restart my phone. But nothing changes. Still couldn't connect. Our wifi's signal is excellent. What to do?
"Netflix keep authenticating on my smart tv, can't load at all. Error code: NW-2-4. My network is working fine. Switched tv off, unplugged it for 5mins, updated software, rebooted router, reconnected it to the local network and Netflix still can't load. Need an update on this issue asap as Customer Services keep saying to contact my service provider. All other apps are connecting fine and DS is great."
With the new update somehow there is a green broken screen with lines displaying in from of certain shows pls check and correct.
Well when Netflix first opened I would have rated it the best of five star but over the years sadly they've sold out some of their best movies and honestly there's just other apps I would rather spend my money on that seems to have movies that pick my interest more or even movies Netflix once had that they don't anymore Netflix is still one of my go-to apps just not my first anymore. especially since they got rid of a lot of their best movies that's what got me All frustrated
"It's a good platform for watching movies, but they often disappoint. Many times they don't have certain seasons from a show and more recently they have released a shockingly disturbing movie which nobody supports or likes yet Netflix resuses to remove it from their platform even though it is offending many people."
"Why don't you stop changing thumbnails for series and movies all the time? It severely reduces instantly recognizability of the items in all menus and lists. Also because other graphical elements are overlapping it. The same, constant thumbnail per object seems much more user friendly to me."
The application works fine however what i don't like is having shows advertised to me and the lack of ability to block genres or subject matter that one dislikes. For example I'm not interested in zombies or cannibalism and would like to have the option to filter all undesirable content.
"App and service work fine. I am getting disappointed in the movie selections. Many of the Netflix Original Series and Movies are good. Some of the foreign films are amazing. Also has at least one or two TV series in each genre from traditional network channels. But very few well-known Hollywood movies recently. So I feel fine exploring the selection on my own, but am hesitant putting on a movie with my family."
"This app works so much better (especially paired with Chromecast) than most other streaming apps. The subs here in NZ are getting a bit steep, despite us having much less content than America. If the prices go up much higher, we'll need to start looking for alternatives."
"Was any1 else able to turn the brightness up & down w/in the app instead of doing it from your phone? For some reason this feature is now unavailable. I'm not sure if it was something Netflix offered or if it was unique to my phone but I do know I haven't changed any settings on either the app or my phone, yet the dimming option just disappeared! Now I am stuck w the brightness all the way down, even the dimmer on my phone settings wont brighten it. Any suggestions to brighten it up again?"
"Dropping my stars from 5 to 3 because of the new screen lock feature. Its handy, but you can no longer touch the screen to remove the playback controls immediately when not in screen lock. I don't use screen lock often because I need to pause and unpause quickly when i'm needed. So now I have to wait 5 seconds or so to wait for the controls to naturally time out and disappear. It's very very annoying. Bring back the old way of tapping to remove playback controls please."
"i m not allowed to dowload anything from the list. it always shows that this title is not availiable to watch instantly. Then why is it on the list for downloading! Netflix is letting me down, not many new movies, the way it always gives you the same choises. Netflix has made some own good films and series, that why i am not deleting it, but it needs a change, the way of looking for a movie to watch is tyring. Netflix need a new refreashing look, sorry it is just getting boring."
"Most likely not going to see this, but still gonna write one. I love this App so much, makes downloading my favorite shows easy. I'm not the streaming kind, so I really appreciate downloading for offline view. First of all, I have just one device tied to my plan, and the moment downloaded videos are up to 1 Gb, it stops me from downloading more. Saying too many downloaded videos. I don't think it has always been that way. I thought my plan restricts me to only devices not number of downloads."
"The content is great but the app needs a bit more improvement: - We should be able to create more than one ""My list"" for each user, so we could better manage the things we want to see. There should be more options to organize our lists, like by genre, or separate movies from series from documentaries, etc. - We should be able to remove shows from the ""continue watching"" list. And mark shows or movies we've seen as ""watched"", even if we've watched them somewhere else."
"Netflix keeps stopping and it gives me the option to report it, which I do... but nothings changing! This happens daily üò†. Also its making me log out of netflix and back in every single day. This is very frutrating considering we pay for this.... I can see having these issues from a free app! Netfix, we need you to do better! These are new issues cause I wasnt having these problems before and its not due to my internet connection because I have a strong signal!"
"Screen mirroring from my huawei y9 prime works fine, meaning audio and video are working, everything that appears on my phone is mirrored exactly on the TV screen, EXCEPT for Netflix videos. When I open the netflix app, everything still works, I can see the Netflix menu on the TV, but once I play a video, the video player shows no video (audio is OK), I can see the frame of the video player, I can see the time bar on the bottom, but just no video. Please fix this."
"I am not able to see any of the programming on my Android phone. I can hear but the screen is black. I have uninstalled the app, updated the app, Cleared my Cache, checked my Color Correction & called my mobile carrier tech support. Please resolve this issue. I can view Netflix on my laptop & my tv. I noticed this yesterday while trying to view and yes, I tried with several different programs and I still could not see anything. May I have a credit please?"
"Just add ""restart series"" as an option, or expand the actual settings we can control. I can barely change anything at all to the point it doesn't even make sense why you added it. I've never seen such a usless ""settings"" for an app. Give us more things to control like ""auto-skip intro"" or ""turn off auto-play previews"", otherwise, just don't let us control anything at all. Until changes are made, your in-app settings will remain retarded. lol"
I normally enjoy netflix but recently there have been problems. 1st. There is something wrong with the brightness whenever i open the app my brightness is normal but when i start playing a movie or show the brightness goes all the way up and its very bright. 2nd. Some movies and shows don't load or do load but for a very long time its not my data because my other wifi needing apps are working its just netflix.
"In the the past few years its kind of went down hill. Great movies like Saving Private Ryan and Titantic and most movies that were big oscar winners, have been taken off, sometimes big movies or series show up only for a few months by seasons or a certain part of the year. Now its just mostly crappy shows, series that were to bad to make on real tv networks, and movies that were to bad to make it in theaters, which mostly likely were because they were low budget films. The best kind of flims or documentaries by bbc, discovery, national geographic or other nature shows is what seems to have a great variety of and what i enjoy most. If your in to Marvel shows like the Flash and Daredevil, you would probably enjoy these super hero shows cause its one of the best series to watch"
"After last update not being able to seewhich episode I just watch became meaningless. Since Natflix doesn't support apps like TvTime, I need to drag up the watchlist to see in which season I'm at and which episode I just finished. I can't even imagine animelovers would go through because of it. Besides, download more part below downloaded episodes doesn't work easily. It could have brought suggestions with correct season picked at least to ease things for users. I will edit my comment after some updates hopefully."
I love the app but it keeps putting everything in spanish! I called support and explained what it was doing and they told me to go watch a rated R movie for 20 minutes and change the audio and subtitles to English and that should fix it because the language settings say English and that didnt work. Everytime a new episode starts I have to go change it to english. Very frustrating!!
"Nx. For an app that runs on a paid service its very disappointing üòë what do y'all use our money for if you dont maintain your darn appüöÆIt's been a week! A whole 2 weeks with app going dark midway while im watching my Korean Dramas. I have to pause and unpause , rewind and unwind throughout the entire 52minutes of my episode because my screen keeps going dark while the audio playsüòë And for a person who just wants to know what happens next that is just wayyy too much workü§ß. Fix it!!!!!!!üôÇ"
"Its works as expected,however, i just have an issue with downloading, when downloading and something happens to disturb the network the download pauses,but when the network comes back the download does not automatically resume which is frustrating for someone like me who works by the second and will have to go back time and again to resume the download"
Some things I'm watching disappears from my continue watching and don't show up when I search for them. When I click on some shows it doesn't show the episodes and so I can't choose the episode I want to watch and can only watch the very next one I was in the middle of watching or about to watch. Other than that everything else works perfectly. But please fix those problems.
"I really love the app. No ads or interuptions, and it's legal. However, whenever I try to download a movie, for example if I'm going on a trip, it won't download. All the other devices in our account can download except this one. I deleted most of my storage, but It just won't download. I don't know if it's my phone causing this problem, but if it's not, please fix this. Thank you!"
Very disappointed in the resent app update!!! Before the update when watching Netflix on a mobile device with the home screen locked you're not able to continue to the next episode from the lock screen. You must unlock your device before you can continue to the next episode. Also if on the lock screen and you're looking to pause what you're watching you aren't able to pause from the lock screen. Please bring that back to the following update and correct this issue.
"Use to think netflix was the absolute best, with the best price, the best movies. Not feeling the same lately with the types of movies being put on. The quality of the movies has seemed to be lower. The price has increased, not happy. The rules are not the best for what we have to pay for. Still watching for the time being, but have been looking into other options due to pricing."
"Great app üëç tho I do wish that you have shows a little earlier.For example season 7 of when calls the heart, the season is coming in 8 months! Other apps already had it a long time ago.Not asking for you to get it right after it comes out but not so late tho. And other series like SpongeBob SquarePants Netflix only has 3 seasons out of 12! Also sometimes the screen will be playing but the audio wont be.Those are the only things that need changing.The rest of the app is very good and enjoyable"
"It seems Netflix are only interested in 1 thing. Your money. Don't seem to reply to anyone's comments here. I've been using it on a 4k Android box and now Netflix doesn't support these devices, I have to download Netflix from other sources. Bloomin joke. There is other apps out there I could use but I choose to pay Netflix. Get it sorted that Android boxes can be used and reply to customer comments here or other apps I will be going to."
It's a great app but when I tap my screen on my Samsung tablet the controls won't go away like they usually do so I constantly fear rubbing something and making controls come and I can't take them off. Another thing if I do want controls I have to tap twice. Whenever I am not on controls double tapping doesn't work for going 10 seconds forward or bacward I have to have controls and wait until it goes away every time. Also same with double tap I can't press skip intro unless I have control up.
"The app crashes while I'm in the middle of watching a show/movie. It will automatically log me out. Sometimes when I open the app, it has logged me out, even though I never logged myself out the last time I opened the app. This is a constant issue since I downloaded netflix on my then-new Samsung 8."
"Normally I would be giving Netflix a 5star rating but ever since I did a recent update my Netflix app keeps telling me I have no Internet connection and to retry and when I press retry it just loads and loads, then I have to either close the app out, restart my phone or uninstall and redownload the app. Netflix app was working fine and perfect until this last update. Please fix it. I have been with you guys for years."
"If using the app with a good phone, solid Wi-Fi, and internal storage: it's a well-designed app. Recent issue: on my Pixel 4, volume now appears to be over amplified in the top (ear) speaker without compensating for the fact that the two lower speakers are built for considerably louder volume while the upper can't handle it. Dangerous?"
"When you're in the netflix app and you turn wifi on, the cast button does not pick up the wifi signals unless you force close and restart the app. It didn't do this before and it's a real hassle for what's seems like an easy fix that someone overlooked. Galaxy S8 active."
"Netflix is a great app, as it has various of movies and series to choose from. Price is reasonable as well and you can share it with your friends, too! However, it does turn my screen black in whatever movies or series that I'm watching everytime they have an update. Hope this will be prevented in the future!"
"It's good the 1st few months (like 6 months or whatever?) you have it, for myself anyhow. Then it seems like stuff doesnt really get add much new shows/movies ?? Also a couple of my super favorite shows got taken off b4 I got to finish the seasons üò• (SOA was hardest too lose !) It is much improvement from freaking antenna TV or cable 100% Could improve tho, more good adult animation would help ! (Like ""The Simpsons"" for example)"
Wish there were more american made horror movies. Tired of reading the screen during horror movies or any movie for that matter. And the voice overs are terrible. I'd personally be happier with an option to not have foreign movies... It gets annoying... Other than that netflix has some issues but over all good.
"It's a great app in general. But just today and yesterday, I was trying to go into Netflix to watch the umbrella academy and it just froze on the Netflix logo. I was confused so I left it and then came back into the app to see that there was an error code. My Wi-Fi is connected and nothings wrong with that but idk why it shows that. Also, there are some tv shows that I really want to watch like andi mack and it's not on here"
"the app itself is good but there should be an option to remove all non English speaking movies ie. indian, Japanese, Chinese movies now i know these nationalitys live in my country and have the same rights and they should be given the option to remove any content they don't want to watch and i cannot understand why Netflix is not showing the same content in every other country as the usa seems to have way more content than where i live in Ireland. you start to make good shows & then cancel them"
"Dear Netflix app team: This app is awesome, but there is a slight problem, during video download sometimes internet interruption happens, and after this interruption the download does not automatically resume. This is very annoying; because I have to check my download each minute to make sure it's not stopped. Please fix this problem Thank You."
"Netflix is a decent app except for the fact that when I try and download movies to watch offline, it says there are downloads on too many devices. I tried deleting downloads on my sisters tablet and it said the same thing. Other people on the Netflix account can download but not me. I tried deleting and downloading again and it said the same thing."
The good: ad free streaming of a lot of classic movies and fun TV shows. Exactly what you hope for. The bad: constant suggestions for Netflix original programs that are built to be binged and forgotten with little to no longevity. Bad marketing and bad faith production My summary: Netflix as a service is great and worth the money if you know they have a few shows you like. Netflix as a producer is headed down the drain. I hope they correct course and revive some of their older shows.
"It has some glitches. I love the windowed mode on the phones, but I noticed with my android it doesn't auto play in windowed mode. On my iPhone it automatically skips the credits and plays the next episode. What is with that? And when the app bugs out it goes back to the previous episode and starts over. It doesn't leave off where it was at."
"I don't like the fact that you get rid of films after a while, instead of just uploading new ones and leaving the old ones as well. Surely you have got enough space to just keep adding new ones? It's extremely frustrating when I went to watch a film again, just to discover that it has been removed. Please try and fix this problem."
To much money and they added the thing where you have to watch only one person at a time and if I wanted multiple people to watch at a time I have to add a subscription for it and not much interesting movies to watch Tubi and frevee.are free and have all different movies and stuff that. Netflix doesn't have and there better and freevee and Tubi don't charge you anything
ADD A QUICK LOGIN for games and accounts I shouldn't have to remember my email and password for a game just saying
"Left beta, had issues with playback. Used to be resolved with the troubleshooting but now, those are useless. Data wasted cause I have to delete the downloads & stream. Can't watch offline for some series & movies, already downloaded and playing but after a few days or weeks not opening it, it doesn't play. CS can't do anything abt. it. Troubleshooting from site doesn't work anymore."
"For the price of the service there needs to be more content to watch. Especially in the anime category. Most of it is old anime from years back and the few new ones you add are mostly Netflix originals. Also for ppl that work it would be good to have the feature to where you can not watch the video and just listen to it. You had something like that a few weeks ago and then it just disappeared out of nowhere. So bring back that feature and add more anime or its gonna be ""Here I come Hulu!"""
"Come on Netflix, get it together. I've been using Netflix for over the past 2 years and I've never seen such a bad UI layout in an app. It takes way too long to find something to watch due to endless scrolling instead of accurate filters and categories. Not to mention sometimes shows appearing in the movie category and vice versa. Like why isn't there a category for content that I gave a thumbs up so I can easily rewatch? The recommendations are also rarely ever accurate. Needs some improvement."
"Decent content. My main qualm is that picture in picture (the setting that makes the video an icon at the bottom of the screen) has stopped functioning. I have made sure the app permission is granted and that the cache is cleared. I have restarted my (android) phone and even unistalled and reinstalled the app, all to no avail. Netflix was the main app I used before this (as I am often using other apps at the same time). Any suggestions on how to fix this would be welcome."
"Netflix is soooooo overrated...I have a subscription but it consistently switches ""My List"" around and puts the content I saved in the order it wants...I reached out to them because 4 shows I just saved to My List didnt show at the beginning of My List...I reached out to them and they said ""We switch Your list around based on Expiring content."" I said why not leave them in the order we saved them and have ""Expiring Soon under them like all other apps...I was told ,that's how we do it...OVERRATED"
"Ive been on netflix for years with no problems or bugs but recently shows haven't been showing up on my phone, but on the TVs in the house they show up and on the other phones in the house they also show up. I've tried to update the app, deleted and re-download the app, and I even reastarted my phone. But nope. The shows still aren't there. Netflix, explain?"
"Has a lots of good movies and series with a good recommendation from something that we watched. But unfortunately, hard to open. Sometimes i cannot get access or open the app. Even when i finally can, the videos won't play and just shut suddenly.. I hope you can fix it because the apps really a good platform to watch."
I would love to know if anyone else has the issue where Netflix just plays on HD. I have the R99 package and I 've set the video to play on low but for some reason it still plays on high. In about 20 mins it took 2 gigs and no it's not some other background thing running. Spoke to Netflix but they not willing to accept responsibility.
"The content is excellent, especially in December. The recommendation system is pretty useless, which means you really have to search for content yourself. I have abandoned shows due to weekly episodes. I think this practice has killed those shows ratings. My biggest frustration is profiles because it's in your face every time you use the app. Disney+ allows default profiles per device. Netflix doesn't. All the streaming providers have unlimited profiles except Netflix."
"App keeps telling me it can't connect ans to retry. TV and computer work fine. When the app does work several things I know are on my list don't show up, even when I search for them on my phone. As far as I can tell, with me at least, this started after the most recent update a few days ago. Please fix."
"I like using this app to watch movies but one thing that bothers me the most is how I cant change the quality of the video, I hate the auto quality because one second its playing in 1080 and then the next second it suddenly drops down 144p which is extremely frustrating. Also, LET ME TURN OFF AUTO PLAY PREVIEWS!! I'm sick and tired of having previews blasting in my ear when looking for an episode to watch or at least let me mute them to where they stay muted every time I open it."
"Unhappily, whenever one selects a particular show (etc) to read, going back leaves you at the top of the entire list. It doesn't save the place you were at. Looking for new shows is cumbersome and slow. Secondly, if there's only one profile skipping through it should be automatic."
"The app seems to lose connection when you lock (controls I mean). It works sometimes and other times not. Give us a forward, a simple 30sec (or maybe 10sec) isn't there is crazy. You can do back so do forward (you can scan but on a tiny phone it's difficult to stop where you want). If they add forward I will update and add another star."
"The first time I used Netflix it was fine a very good experience but... after sometime whenever I open it, It keeps saying ""Sorry we couldn't reach the server please try again later"" Please fix this problem asap! But there is not any other issue like that on my phone for other apps on Play Store the option Compatibility says 'It works on your device'. Then why it doesn't works?"
"The app was exceptionally good until now. Recently I started experiencing troubles with the app on my phone. Whenever I choose a random movie or TV show, it doesn't play and instead it says that the title is not available to watch instantly. I don't know what happened with the app, but that's really frustrating as I'm paying for it. Please help to fix!"
"Can't get the app to work on my new Note 10, although it was fine on my Galaxy S9+. It won't let me reload the app because it is already transferred from the S9+, but won't let me take the app off the Note 10+ so I can start fresh either. I'm with T-Mobile, so Netflix is free, and I'd really like to use it again."
"In App: Having brightness controlled ONLY within the app and not by your device is not a feature I like. Thumbnail viewing for fast forward/rewind is terrible. Other UI layout and functionality is fine. Casting: Functionality is one of the worst for any streaming service. Slow to load, no thumbnail scanning, volume control increments are +10 only, doesn't recognize when your TV turns off and have to force an app restart. I mainly cast streaming apps and casting Netflix is my least favorite."
So far my experience is good mostly because it helps me to continue from where I left. But what concerns me the most is that it doesn't have a huge range of movies which I really like to watch again and my personal preference is horror and that category only includes a couple of good movies. Wish they will soon add more.
"Love the options of shows and movies, but I'm really disappointed by the autoplay of trailers when I tap on a show to read about. I would prefer no spoilers and an option to pause the trailer. Plus, the sound autoplays, so it becomes distracting while trying to figure out what I actually want to watch."
"i wonder why netflix is always working on background. on my last charge, during more than 12h battery, i had the device 1h05m held awake (working on background) and 30m of that 1h05 was only for netflix! please fix this! this app is draining battery while the device is sleeping. Clearing the cache, data, uninstall, reinstall, nothing had solved this!"
"Usually good, but now even when I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it freezes when I open it ...not sure if this is a bug"
"Please fix whatever bug Netflix is experiencing right now. No matter what I try, the picture always freezes or is completely black with just the audio running. All other streaming apps on my phone work fine. This has just started happening recently. It's really sad, I love netflix. Please fix it asap."
"Ever since they added the screen brightness adjustment feature I have not been able to lower the brightness to the minimum level. The lowest seems to be 20% or so. If I do it manually and hold it, it gets darker but then forces it back up. I have very sensitive eyes and this makes it very hard for me to watch Netflix in bed. Would really like this to get fixed."
"Mediocre app which lacks a lot of things. One of the most anoying things for me, is that there is no locking option for the gui. Another one is that the brightness cannot adapt to the system setting. In general if this was a video playing app, I would not recommend it. Plese product group, take a look at the mainstream video playing apps and adopt some of their features."
"[Update edit: Disappointed with the sound (no 5.1) & video quality of Anime and many non-Netflix ori shows/films.] Netflix has a lot of original shows, but the quality varies. It's trying to take on too much, and is being spread thin. It should sacrifice Oriental Asian shows & films (Mainland especially), and stop competing with services that are focussed on that. Jap-Anime is fine."
"I'm not suree what is happening with Netflix since the last 2 update. however whenever there's a new update,even when I'm watching a video my screen will just turn black while audio still playing. So even right after the update I have to reinstall the app to make it work properly again. It's such a hassle for mw to download series I already downloaded.. it's a great app before but if they fix the issue I'll change my rating for this app"
The app usage is great with no complains on that front. This would go straight to 5 stars if I could have Ultra HD and HDR streaming on my phone but it doesn't allow this even though it says it does. My phone does support it and it is in the list of phones that Netflix provides compatible.
The service has become pretty pricey. I've mostly kept it because I like to watch k-dramas but you can really stream those anywhere. Two problems that frequently happen with Netflix are that the sound randomly goes out while watching and doesn't return even if you restart. Or the show will randomly be unable to load while other shows are able to be played. It glitches a lot more than it used to. I'd rather see them cut down on too many original content shows than keep raising the price.
"Super cool! One problem. When I tried to download an episode of one of my favorite shows, it downloaded and loaded up. But as soon as it got to about 3 minutes in the video file it kinda... lagged out. This happened with other shows, too. Please fix this soon."
"App works well and visually is pretty straightforward, but frequently disappearing series can be frustrating. I also miss one of the features from the early days of netflix; it asked you to rate what you had viewed and used that to recommend things. Was a good feature."
"Ive requested sooooo many movies and shows but noy one has come onto netflix , i have it on my tv and all it does is load ( wifi connection is fine)"
This is a great app however twice during the past week when I have tried to download programmes to my Samsung tablet it has come up with an error code BRM.441 and stops the download. The only thing that gets it working again is uninstalling and reinstalling the app. This is really annoying.
"Great with a few big frustrations. Everyone knows what this app is and does. I really prefer to read about a movie or series, such as detailed summaries and reviews, before committing time to watching anything. Netflix seems determined to dump you into watching content at every turn. I find I have to leave the platform to research, which is a big PITA. I use Netflix far less than I otherwise might, because I only come for content I already know I want, and never to discover new content."
"It's great except for the fact that it tends to give my smart TV issues at times. Right now all I see is a black screen when I click the Netflix app on my TV. Won't let me reinstall either. Other than this issue, of course love it."
"Good but some issues. Using it with my Chromecast Ultra, Pixel 3, and a 60Mbps connexion, it frequently shows choppy framerate. Used to be fine with the same setup, so probably related to an update creating the issue. When it works normally, though, it has the best selection of original content, so kudos on that. ;)"
"After the new system updates, I cant seem to open netflix on my phone, it says there's been an error reaching the netflix servers. And it doesn't let me uninstall netflix from my phone, and when I do get that option I later can only update and open it, so its never actually uninstalled, other than that I love netflix with all its shows, thank you."
The app is wonderful but most Netflix movies aren't on it
"Too much of the same, covens of this, magic fairies or light vs dark, but with the programming as of late, Netflix has had some unchallenged undisputed heavyweights, but it seems like there are only a few shows or movies that can't be gotten through cheaper streaming service bundles with more variety. Still would put Netflix up against Prime any day, for originals, but Netflix need to kick up the Kobra Kai, Children of War, amazing cinematics. Kudos on the meditating interactive apps though."
Thank you for going up on your prices! It has taught me and my family a lot about not being afraid to explore the unknown. My family wouldn't have explored other streaming apps if it wasn't for Netflix's influx in prices. Thanks to Netflix I have found the beauty in looking at shows nearly instantly due the Hulu and the premier movie showings with Paramount plus. All which are significantly affordable compared to you. Thank you Netflix for opening our eyes!
The app runs the shows I watch smoothly. The only issue that's quite annoying to deal with is that it's not saving the spot where I last watched. Either the video starts at the beginning of the episode or sometimes I need to flip two episodes ahead to find my spot. Hopefully this gets fixed soon.
"Yes the apps great. What's not,is cancelling shows after 1 season that's a hit. I understand covid messed up scheduling for actors so some were cancelled. But one season is early enough to recast a actor especially when the show's great!I read that netflix sees no value in more then 20 episodes which means 2 season's.The upkeep cost is more then the profit. Some most streamed shows have 6+ seasons.Not netflix originals but it shows we as viewers like to watch characters grow, storylines change."
"Netflix doesn't always update their movies. All their movies are outdated. We're paying for it, so we should get the best experience. Also, it's fustrating when you don't find movies where they're supposed to be, sometimes, they're elsewhere. All these has been giving me serious problems."
"I used to have no issues with Netflix here on my phone because I was able to watch and download videos properly but it has been 3 days since my Netflix won't open. I tried restarting my device and it will work but after not using it for a long period of time, it won't open again, also it won't allow me to download anymore like it would show its downloading but won't actually download, on the other hand, my laptop sometimes does this to, hope you fix it soon"
"I've been having trouble for days to have an episode play the whole entire way. Without an error message. Or it pausing for about 5 minutes in between the scenes. I've restarted the computer on my phone. Clear it out all the cookies. Installed and uninstalled the app. And still having the problem. The app works super fine on my computer. But not so much on the phone. I wish the programmers of this app, could fix this."
"The cost for Netflix continues to go up yet the current content seems to be less enjoyable. My family now use it as a LAST OPTION when choosing a program to enjoy together. There are other affordable options that may not have as much content but I find definitely get more use in my household. Compare your prices to an average persons income, per country and adjust it accordingly,(YOU CHARGE TOO MUCH), perhaps for the whole family you could focus on NEW programs that are not just rated TV-MA."
I installed Netfkix app 2 weeks ago it worked fine for the first few days. Then it started to freeze up during and after I watched a tv show. I will reinstall the app. I am also disappointed in the limited selection. I was surprised tv show and movies a few years old not available on Netflix.
Casting from phone was fine for a long while. Now for about a month i have had 2 different phones(S7 edge /S8) and both had the battery drain at least 30%/hour reinstall and new phone didn't change the issue. There does not appear to be any news of the issue online very odd.
"hmm a little disappointed. Ive been a long time netflix user. I just got myself a new low budget tablet (chuwi hi9 pro) and disappointed that Netflix doesn't support hd on this device. I looked into after I realized how cruddy my video was looking and its only a set amount of devices that support it. i get 1440p on YouTube, hd on Hbo go and hulu. I hope maybe one day to see this change. If not I guess I'll stick to my other services"
"It's a pretty good app don't get me wrong, but the reasons I have it 3 is because it says I have errors playing the video. And when I try to get in Netflix sometimes it says that there is an error. Also kinda upset they're taking most animes off. That's the main reason I downloaded it tbh. Other than that the apps is pretty good. It needs some fixes though"
"The app works fine but I can't adjust the brightness at all. My phone is set to max brightness but Netflix is still too dark. I can't see what is going on most if the time. Youtube is very bright compared to Netflix. Yes, I did turn off auto brightness."
The infrastructure of this app is terrible you get a line of 6 content entries that then need scrolling one at a time . You then have the same thing going down with pretty much the same content meaning you can make 60 search attempts and see just 18 bits of content. Why not have one screen with all content available with a more defined searching options at the very top. Right now I can't justify paying month after month when good content gets hidden by an algorithm.
I love Netflix as a whole but I have to say I'm very disappointed that the prices were raised and there's still constantly issues with playback. Half the time it takes more than 1 try just to get the app to open on my TVs (2 different ones) and it still will continue to have issues loading titles. Find a fix and I'll update my review
"Mainly what I want to focus on here until it gets fixed is the inability to turn off the show/series ""autoplay next episode"" feature from the app. I know it will eventually prompt and ask you whether or not you would like to continue watching, but sometimes I watch an episode or two of a show to go to bed and I have a data limit on my phone. I fall asleep watching and it just keeps playing for hours. Please fix this, you really should have more settings options. Yeesh."
Downloaded Netflix and worked great at first but now everytime I watch a show it stops and I have to keep pushing the play button until the movie is over... is there something I can do to stop that from happening... I just want to watch a movie with no interruptions
Netflix just downgraded my account to ad supported and took away the ability to cast movies to a TV.... greedy much? 02.2024
Shuffle feature is a great idea... Except you can't choose between searching for a tv show or a movie and besides it keeps showing stuff I've seen before or have no interest in. You really need to update this feature especially with an actual random setting not just going from what you'd think we'd like. Try as well a randomizer based on genres to suit a mood you're in.
"Recently tried to cast to my chromecast, tried everything from reconnecting internet and restarting my phone to unplugging the chromecast and it still isn't working. I really love Netflix, but it's even better on the big screen. I hope they can find a way to patch this for Samsung soon because I want to binge Supernatural üò©."
"Netflix is amazing don't get me wrong but at this point if you want to watch in 4k it will cost you like 18-19 euro a month, bit ridiculous knowing that they don't got a crazy amount of amazing shows on it and half of them shows don't even have all the seasons yet. Maybe want stop raising prices and start adding some good tv-shows and movies, squid games being a massive success doesn't mean u gotta up the prices again, you do this every few years!"
"App is alright, I don't like the homepage as it's impossible to find anything to watch with the random sections and there's too many Netflix originals shoved in your face (which aren't very good most of the time). It's good for series' but most films I want to watch aren't there, even the very popular classics (not necessarily Netflix's fault). Isn't very good at reccomending stuff to watch, you have to know what you want to watch."
"The app works well, and I spend entirely too much time watching shows (which means they are doing a good job - and I need to watch less tv). I don't like that I can't have more control over content (i.e. it isn't hard to see that I would pay extra to be able to control some content [i.e. block swears or scenes that I deem inappropriate, etc.])."
"I love Netflix and usually have no problems but the experience on my Chromebook has become so bad. Everything I try to watch becomes pixellated with semi opaque sqauares over parts of the picture. Completely ruins the experience. Have updated App and tried clearing cahe, data etc but still no joy. It's not chromebook or internet connection as Prime Video works perfectly. Either bad app or just simply not compatible for full HD chromebook."
like it's Netflix. it is great to watch my shows amd movies. I downloaded it knowing it is not optimized for my device. However i would think a streaming company would ensure there product can be used by any device... it took 3 days until problems arose and i can hardly watch anything now. please do somin
"hey Netflix, after the recent update I noticed that whenever English is spoken, the English subtitle didnt show up. pls fix this. sometimes I watch Netflix with no sound cause I just prefer reading the subs and esp if it's a non-English program. so I'll be reading the subs then suddenly the character threw in a few English phrases then I'll be lost in translation üòÖ"
When l was see the movies sometime frezzin and after lost the movie and automatically chanche a other movie 30 years ago .. horror movies so 1 hour later lost the movie and ......... Nope pops woauuuuuu thanks
"I tried to change the payment method from CC to digital wallet Dana, but the app not respond"
I've had Netflix for a minimum of 10 years until the last few years. New shows take years to get the new seasons by then you totally forgot everything about the show. You would figure with the huge price increase Netflix would be better at getting their shows out quickly to keep their customers interested in Netflix. Don't get me wrong they have good shows that they're producing but when it takes two to three years for a new season I personally lose interest.
It's really buggy it restarts some episodes. Other times it completely restarts the series. It kicks me out a lot. I click on one show or movie and it plays a completely different one that I haven't even seen. Also I wish that if you say not interested on something that it wouldn't keep showing up. It's really good otherwise.
I have to agree with a few people who are having this problem for the last few days Netflix App has been freezing and stopping saying error or playing and the screen isn't caught up with the dialogue please look into this matter I've never had a problem like this before and I've been a Netflix customer for years and have had this App for a long time. And I'm certain that it's not my phone with the issue it's the App
"After reading the reviews, I noticed I wasn't the only one experiencing the same problem. When I updated my netflix, everytime I play a movie, my screen just stops working but the audio continues to play. I can't even exit the app since my phone just freezes. Tried to restart a lot of times. I hope this bug or whatever it is gets fixed."
"System Household Device. Why the current Netflix household system is so disturbing, especially if we've logged out of smart TV and only logged in on a smart phone or tablet? Not always people are at home and use the same IP address all the time. I have to re-log in every time a household notification appears. Please change; just use a verification password for security."
App crashing. Since last update.
"#update, it has been fixed for now. Keeping 2 starts in reserve for a suitable and stable solution. Most of the titles are available to watch from my pc browser but not available on app! Contacted support team but they kept whinnying about vpn. It's so annoying, I may end up not renewing my subscription next month if it continues like this."
"Nice touch on the upgrade adding a lock button. But I really think you guys can do better by adding a 'minimize' option, so that it roll over other apps. That way you can watching a shower while doing other things on your mobile. Do that I'll really appreciate it. Thanks."
"The app does not work very well when watching hdr or ultra hd content in my samsung s10+. The black areas is fussy and pixelated. However, watching the same content on my sony xperia xz premium there are no issues watching the same content. I believe the application is not optimized correctly for samsung 10+ as other hdr/ultra hd content plays fine so not device issue."
"Theres been many bug lately with the latest update, it took forever to loads and its not because of my connection, and the fact that theres many movies/series that are not available in all countries is kinda disappointing, and i wish theres a watched history for movies/series that i had already finished, sometimes i just want to see what movies/series i already watched, also a A-Z search option would be nice, so we can see all the movies/series that available by alphabetical order"
Netflix makes lots of efforts to find movies that I might like but is missing the one key search feature I would love. I would like to search based on movie or show ratings instead of just subject matter. Maybe the film is an adventure movie rated PG13 VS one rated R. I might watch the first as a family but avoid the other until the kids are asleep. Right now I cannot filter based ratings and make my own choice as to whether or not I want to watch it as a family.
"Bought a Samsung Galaxy A32 & discovered Netflix bugs up on it. 10 minutes into any show, the image suddenly gets very choppy (like 4 fps). Have scoured all the tech help/online forums, sounds like it's a common issue with no solution. Only way to fix it (temporarily) is either keep tapping the screen (the problem disappears while the navigation bar is showing) or shut the app down completely & start over. Then it's good for another 10 mins. I just use the other stream services on my phone now."
"Not bad, but multiwindow is not a supported feature for Android which causes me to toggle between multiple apps. Upon return to Netflix there is a delayed response to pick up where it left off which is time consuming and frustrating at the same time. PLEASE ADD MULTIWINDOW SUPPORT!!!"
"Upgrade was not a good one. I'm getting subtitles, which I can turn off for each episode but it is annoying. But lately, the app cuts off in the middle if an episode and that is just wrong. I was only two episodes in this morning and it just stopped and went back to the home screen. Please fix it."
Netflix actually lose its supremity there are less series and movies now. And also comparing to other ott platforms Netflix has the highest price and in past it is not an issue with unlimited top shows and anime now it lost almost all anime and top shows. Now it's a burden and also user interface should be more useful and don't make customer go to web site for changing even subtitle size and colour
Great app! But the issue I had was they don't get movies on Netflix first thing. They still don't have movies that came out 5 years ago. Other wise I love this app it's great! So please bring out more movies and tv shows! I also noticed once in a while it will log me out of my account I don't know why but please fix that!
"The app is great, and the selection is sufficient. However the service severely lacks when it comes to settings and customization for individuals. Not all the automations are able to be toggled (most notably, there's no way to toggle the skipping of a tv show intro)."
"Maybe I don't know how to access the total list I get mostly the same shows offered to me , when I check for a particular movie it isn't available. The continue watching I would like to remove movies I tried but didn't like. The circle on continue watching makes it that much harder for me to see what it is, so I keep starting things I don't want to watch. The movies are not in HD so sometimes pixelated. I am happy overall with the app."
"Love the app mostly, but recently the play button stopped functioning. For instance if I have to pause a movie or show the 10sec plus or minus buttons still function, but I cannot just hit play to resume where I left off. It's a giant hassle to be honest and I hope you can patch it quickly so it works. Galaxy s8 fyi ....thanks."
Need the playback speed button back. It's very useful especially when just re-watching shows and for people on the go. I don't even use the app now that the playback speed button is gone. I just watch on chrome coz I got the extensions. Please bring it back.
Audio description shall be given on the first page. Many times we have to play trailer of the video or to play part of the whole movie just to check in what language it is available or we have to guess if we know the actors else skip it. This is the only thing that Amazon prime has better than Netflix. They tell us in description about languages and subtitles available.
"There are so many things I don't like about the Netflix app. Some Netflix shows display resolution. The lack of customisation you are given for viewing and the rubbish design layout / ui... Is really frustrating irritating. GET BETTER. What made me really want to post this is you cannot even customiser the font color of subtitles in the app. You have to access Netflix on web browser and why did they think setting subtitles to white was a good idea, instead of the default black. Really dumb."
"Choppy videos. Lag audio . Sometimes crashing. So many times to update . I've had Netflix for YEARS, saddened at the fact that I'm having so much trouble with it. Unfortunately, I've been thinking about moving to something else... please fix."
"I HATE that Netflix now controls the brightness on my phone when I watch. It's beyond horrible! Most of the time I can't see the show because it's set too dark. Netflix, we are capable of choosing how bright our screens need to be too watch üì∫ in our environment. We're not all watching in a dark basement. Sometimes I watch in my car at lunch in the bright sunshine (at least I used to)."
"Since I've been using Netflix on my phone it seemed really ok! Every movie/series loaded fast and perfectly..but there's one bug...one time i just got logged out of Netflix for no reason..and i had to log in back...then after a month i got logged out agian..i dont know if it's from my phone or if it's from the app, but if it is, then i would wish if this bug could be fixed."
"I've been getting error messages quite often these past few weeks. It always says "" Sorry, we could not reach the Netflix service."" I understand that glitches do really happen in any apps or sites but this one is kinda annoying already because it has been happening repeatedly. I hope you can do something to fix it."
"Generally it's good. But recently the ""coming soon"" section has been all over the place. It's so hard to scroll through it without it freezing on you a couple of times. This of course is due to the autoplay feature. Please go back to the old version when we had the option of playing or stopping the previews."
"Kids Mode > Home Screen I can't see the top of the app under my notification bar & my navigation bar overlays the bottom menu also can't see Now Playing or Cast button. If I'm in Downloads or More screens I can see Now Playing, bottom menu and notification bar doesn't overlap. In other non- Kids Mode profiles no problem. App up to date, uninstalled, cleared cache & app data. Only in Kids Mode. Help? Suggestions? Old Samsung Tab Lite & now brand new Samsung Tab A 10.5. Not running app fullscreen"
I'm just a little confused on why Netflix skipped about 500 episodes of One Piece. Please resolve this confusing problem.
"Is ok, after previous update started losing last shows episode -still remembering spot in it so not that bad. Would be good that same show would not listed in almost all categories, Option to exclude- seen, disliked shows and movies As well as rotating listed shows in showed categories - of I go through 3 times I probably want something else, nor can I dislike them or anything to hide unwanted ones."
It's a good app and definitely lives up to the standard/premium name but the only problem is that I'm watching an anime and it has 4 seasons but they've only put 2 seasons on Netflix along with a few series and it's annoying because then I have to find a streaming website that will get that up for me. it's a bit annoying and I hope this will be fixed.
"Netflix is great. Negative rating for Switzerland: recently, most film/series titles and some subtitles became unconditionally in German language, even in French-speaking part of Switzerland. No English titles anymore even for movies/series in English. Descriptions and most subtitles are still in English. For how long?"
"it is a good application for ""legal"" movie watching. freezes up and has bad quality sometimes, but it gets the job done. i just miss the good ol' showbox days, when showbox dominated the competition. now that showbox is gone i guess netflix will be a temporary solution. but thats all it will ever amount to."
"Would give 5 stars but two problems, 1: Can't turn off ""are you still watching"", without turning off autoplay. Should have a dedicated option to turn off ""are you still watching"". 2: When choosing the search option, there should be an auto focus in the searchbar, why should I have to click in there again to search? App is worth 5 stars if these problems are sorted out..."
"Netflix is good, but compared to Amazon Prime, it's overpriced. Amazon is 1 payment for its shop, it's music app and it's screening app (can be watched on different devices at same time) for $9.99pm. Netflix charges more for 1 device at a time only membership. Plus some of the TV shows are years behind what's available on free to air TV!"
"The app is mostly good, but streaming is extremely buggy. The app has a tendency to hide streaming controls, and they only come back when switching to ""Coming Soon"" or ""Downloads"". Sometimes the show but don't work, or only show the next episode button (which then doesn't work)."
If they could just fix the interface and stick with the fixed version but every time Netflix updates it's like trying to navigate a mystery app until you get the hang of it then as soon as you have it figured out oh what's this a new update? Now I can't read the summaries of a show? Oh this category has been revamped now it's harder to find what I'm looking for. Otherwise it's fine.
"A bit dissaipointed here. I use Netflix on my PS4 where I get gorgeous HD quality. My previous phone, a Galaxy S6 also played HD. However my new phone, an S7 edge, only plays in standard def. I queried this with Netflix support, where it was revealed that the specific model of my phone (SM-G935FD) is not supported by HD. I'm just rather perplexed why a newer more high spec phone can't do what it's predecessor could. Not really a deal breaker as I primarily watch on PS4. Patch please?"
"Works on everything but tablets and phones lately. Used to be a [4.5/5 ] app but leaning to [2.5/5] Older Smart TVs and boxes aren't getting updates and fixes as fast or at all. So After offline download was added the app has been haywire since. Doubt they care enough to fix and clean up the whole system. Just like Hulu and AzPrime, clunky and getting clunkier."
Downloads don't work I tried to download a season of a television show on Netflix it took me a whole day to do and when I eventually got on my train. (taking me on a 9 hour trip from country to country) and it gave me error (5.7.) I went onto their website to see what happened and the fix the problem. The advise was to restart your device. No acknowledgment of why this has happened just restart your device. I have done about 6 times now. Other than that it's been smooth sailing just a heads up.
"Using Chromebook. Keeps saying that the device is not working, restart. So i restart it, then it says the application is not working. Never had any problems on this device in the last 2-3 years so very confused. I uninstalled and installed again. It still works perfectly fine on my phone, wife's phone, TV, smart TV...i'm lost. Why not on the Chromebook? Looks like i'm suddenly not the only one. I'm going to assume this is due to overload bc of COVID."
"Netflix is good but I want there to be more movies, and TV show. Like movies or TV show that goes viral. Like THE BOYS and GEN V."
"I am constantly having to uninstall and reinstall for Netflix to work through Chromecast. I thought it was my wifi connection first, then my device but after using all my resources (I do tech support) and checking to see that indeed chromecast connected with all other devices and apps, it is in fact just Netflix."
"It's fine but ever since that new update, it's been freezing with the audio still playing, black screens, the app needing to be reset, and the app saying a show/series can't be played and to try again later. And all that has happened in the span of 10 minutes. Please fix it"
Been using Netflix on my phone for a while now but the most annoying thing about it. Is they are putting the same movies on over and over. Repeats and old nonsense. We need more modern and updated movies. Movies that had featured in our cinema should play Here. Although I have seen a few of them we need more. ‚òù
"I'll start with a positive, it's easy to navigate, and has an array of choices. However the one irritating thing is if you've been like a normal person that's worked all week had no time for TV (hence why I purchased app TV) then you finally get a day to yourself to watch what ever you wish only to open a show and it's already at Season 2 and no possible way to start it from season one because they don't allow this. So it's a close call to uninstall!"
"I have been having a huge issue with the app crashing. It often crashes as soon as I open it and sometimes while I'm in middle of watching a show. Everytime the app crashes, my phone is forced to restart. This doesn't happen with any other streaming apps."
"Love Netflix, but recently it's been running in the background and draining my battery. I have to force stop the app, but it automatically starts up again even if I don't use the app all day. I'm starting to think about uninstalling it, but I like the programs available on it. If this issue is fixed, I would recommend it more."
"I give 3 star, i enjoy evry movies and series i watched, but when i put shows on my list. I just found out that you guys keep deleteng movies. Once i put it on my list, i click the i love it, thinking that would help to make the show stays on netflix. But your really keep deleteng movies and shows. Im so upset really, and sad because i cant find it anywhere. I payed ervery month.üòî"
"App has become an issue. Since the last update, 13/09, the app will not login to Netflix server, unless I turn off my VPN. The VPN is set to my resident country, so it's not as though I'm trying to access a different regions content. Would appreciate any tips to resolve. Thanks."
"Hi Netflix development team, recently I need to sign in everyday when I use Netflix.I just change to the new Samsung galaxy fold 3 phone, assuming the problem is the app assumes me on 2 different devices when I ""FOLD"" and ""UNFOLD"", so it keeps prompting me for login. Can you help fix this problem? Btw, the streaming contents are great, thanks."
Some good content on this app streaming quality is terrible at times video stops but audio continues and this has nothing to do with my device or wifi. problem is fixed only when i restart the app but will occur 2-3 times in one episode. Please fix the problem asap... Just noticed a few weeks later that the only streaming i have problems with are netflix originals any other film or series i have no issues with... Sort it out netflix
"Netflix cool and all, but it's really frustrating when I'm trying to watch one episode then it just exits the video and returns to the menu like after every 30 seconds. I've had Netflix for a few months, and this only started happening recently."
"It was good until recent update which broken the resume feature. No matter where you stop the movie, it starts playing from beginning. Hope you identify and resolve this issue. And one more suggestion from my end is to keep a category ""Most Liked"" videos (From previous watches, 80-90% of them are worthy watch)"
"This app is good and all, but I have to give an honest review.. My netflix account was on 3 months subscription and I can watch all the shows I want on tv, but the thing is I cant watch it on tv anymore. It didnt even notify me but it says something about plans which are confusing. If you have any suggestions please help me."
Unbelievable that Netflix still cannot manage getting the app to work offline. Content that I have downloaded to an SD card is unavailable when I go to airplane mode. We resolved these problems 10 years ago! Clearly Netflix has some work to do when Amazon gets this right.
"It's ok at best, not many good shows and kinda expensive. On the other hand we have the ability to download showsnsonwe can watch them offline, this can be exploited to have a mutlide if people on at the same time and still being able to access shows you download. Easy to cancel, worth the money for a 1-2 active screen subscription and anything above that I wouldn't recommend it unless it's for kids as there are many cartoons and kid shows, make a child account to cencor certain content."
It needs to add Criminal minds back and its very glichy tho but it good
"In my opinion Netflix does not add enough movies each month. It always seemed like I had seen everything on Netflix and very few or different titles were being added. I got so bored with Netflix that I cancelled and did not look back over one year ago. The content was good, just NOT enough of it. I prefer the HBO app even at a higher price. Sorry, just saying..."
"First off. Whenever I turn on a show it puts my brightness at like 2%. Annoying because I cant change it. It sends me so many notifications on my samsung galaxy 10+ it can take my battery from 100 to 80 in less than an hour even tho I block it from sending me notifications which means netflix has some kind of adware other than that good. Edit: also it says top free but you have to pay 8 dollars a month, be ready to pay if you want it."
"Netflix has a great selection of shows and movies but I can no longer watch it on my phone because it is constantly lagging and freezing while the audio continues to play. Being able to watch it on my phone is one of the main reasons I subscribe, if this doesn't get fixed I will be canceling my subscription and moving on to something that actually works!!!"
"I love the app, it does not lag, gives good quality even with lower internet speed. But I have two issues that I think should be addressed: 1. It does not have any kind of rating associated with the shows. Each time I want to watch something, I want to see how much it score on IMDB, for that I have to open my browser and search the show or movie. It becomes difficult when you want to add things in watchlist. Please add IMDB or any other rating attribute. 2. For slow internet it only loads audio."
Its ik but i doesnt release some other anime season like haikyus new movie and mashle already has a season 2
Using Chromecast on this sucks. Constantly have to re-download the app because chromecast wont show up on it yet chromecast works fine with other apps on my phone. Also after i leave the app and come back the chromecast menu thing is gone so i need to try and connect it again which doesnt work 90% of the time.
"Best streaming platform out there. But one feature which is missing in this app is to choose quality like in YouTube videos. We have to change video quality from account settings. Add option to select quality right from the video, just like YT and Hotstar. Add option to choose 240p and 360p video playback in case of less data remaining. Even in data saver mode, the video plays on 480p by default."
"This app is great when it comes to watching things on my phone but any time I have ever tried to watch something on my samsung cromebook all the shows just say ""loading..."" but don't ever actually play anyting. I let my computer sit for an hour while trying to load a show and it sill just said loading. I even tried to delete the app and reinstall it and it did absolutly nothing. So if there is anything that can be done to fix this please help me with this situation."
"It's a great app and has a great variety, but as of recently it's been playing up; the app keeps freezing, the video will stop but the sound continues, and it even freezes up my whole phone. I'm not having any problems with any other app, only Netflix."
I love it but they keep changing the price to a higher one and they swap out movies and rotate them sometimes they dont plan on bring back some shows i originally got it for The Vampire Diaries but they removed the show to make room for other shows which i didnt think were even close to being good. i also did notice that most movies on this platform are about sex and have a lot of sexual content and i dont really like that too much either it seems like more and more movies just dont have plot.
Needs an option to get rid of content you dont like
"I've decided to update my review in Hope's that developers may see this. I like the app, my family uses it often and on a daily basis though, I have run into some problems such as, streams lag and quality of frames drop severely even when I am in a place that offers tremendous signal. A complaint I have about the app is that certain locations get certain shows and movies that other locations dont have to offer. -Quinn"
"Great app but the last update is glitchy I'm the latest update Netflix got the option to adjust the brightness on screen, cool concept but it's not working as planned. (At least in my Galaxy note 9) the color profile changes and saturation gets all over the place. Exiting the app the colors on my phone are all messed up. This did not happen in older versions and it is not the quality of image we expect from Netflix. Please guys fix this."
"2 major issues: ¬π It won't let you play a video and download in the background simultaneously. Its an entertainment app I think this should be changed. ¬≤ Most frustrating problem is when I put few episodes on download and if I open the app to check the progress, all of a sudden download speed just drops. 16/05 After updating app today the playback pauses if I start to forward to go back few seconds. It just gets stuck and won't play, so I am forced to close the app and restart it."
"It's a nice app but it currently has a problem where it won't let me keep track of what I watch and won't let me add shows or movies to my list. When I watch a TV series I have to scan every episode and season to find out where I left off, it's really infuriating. If it doesn't get fixed soon then I'm switching platforms and will be leaving Netflix."
"Okey, I love Netflix, but recently have been dealing with the issue of anytime I try to watch something, it continuously freezes and just loads for a long time and I just cant watch anything. it's been happening for a while now and I just decided to cancel my subscription instead of dealing with the hassle."
App player controls freeze every single time when casting. It requires me to force stop the app and reconnect with the chromecast in order to get controls back. Lock screen controls continue to work though but not in app controls. Has been happening for about a year or so.
It's a great app and I love watching Netflix on the go. The only problem is the multi device downloading. You can only have so many downloads over all and it sometimes says you can't download any more even if you have only downloaded a small amount of episodes.
"when im watching in the middle of the video, the messenger bubble pops up and i just replied to my dad, that when i wanted to continue watching the screen was just black.. i tried to refresh Netflix but still black when i try to watch. All the movies,series,episodes is still black, PLEASE fix it. all though i like hiw Netflix was made. Aside from the black thing :)"
"a very good app with a very good content. but .i don't understand the following ... if i like a show and i've just finished watching let's say the 3rd season, it was the last season available on netflix, to find out that the next season is actually available on netflix but its dosn't show in my region, how am i suppose to continue watching it on netflix instead of going online and watch the rest of the season out there FOR FREE BY THE WAY.i'm thinking of canceling my account..just watch online"
"I prefer Amazon Prime but Netflix has become a household name and one can find great content, especially when it comes to series. Not nearly enough films imo but if you make good use of your VPN (while you still can) you practically have access to all of their movies & series available world-wide. Thank me later üëåüòÅ"
So much grr... so auto download is a great idea! (When you watch a series it notices which you have watched and is supposed to download the next set) Well is doesn't work so well when it downloads them out of order often going over its preset limit and canceling the downloads of several numerical episodes.... also it will erase and redownload episodes you haven't even watched but not finish downloading cause they warn you you have only one more download before such and such date so its bot really auto downloading... did work right at on3 point but deff isn't now... so you get a solid mehhhh from me...
"Pretty good app, only thing I hate is trying to remove shows or films I don't want to continue watching from the continue watching list. It should be easier, a process that does not involve leaving the app and scrolling through a list to try and find what you want to remove. This needs to improve, it's actually ridiculous this isn't a thing."
"I like that I can download shows, but I'm feeling like even when I download them it streams them over Chromecast. I'm trying to save data because I live in a rural area and do not have high speed internet at home. I tried mirroring my phone on Chromecast but Netflix restricts this for their videos. The video on the television was black although it played on my phone."
"I love Netflix but the one big killer for me is the fact that sometimes shows like ""Grey's Anatomy"" won't show up anywhere on the mobile app but when I access from a laptop or TV it's still there and shows up on my continue watching list. It's quite frustrating when I really only use Netflix to watch that but otherwise I love this app!"
Netflix has been great apart from if I start messing with the brightness the screen will go completely black and I'll have no sound. I'll click on what I want to play and then it goes completely black after a second or two. It's not to do with the brightness being too low. Please fix this
"About to uninstall the app because it overrides my phone's contrast/luminosity. I can't watch anything because it's almost pitch black whenever I launch a movie or tv show. Seems to be a recurring issue on Android or Samsung phones. Otherwise Netflix will still be on my TV, great choice of movies, animes, and TV shows."
"I enjoy netflix, have had it for years. What I don't enjoy is them raising the damn price every year....this year its $2 more per month...I already pay more than double what disney plus costs per month. You guys claim it's because more shows are added, but how many shows are deleted too? I'm seriously considering canceling my service and switching to something cheaper after this last monthly raise is payment. Every other streaming service is cheaper, figure it out before you loose us Netflix!"
Please stop dubbing Asian shows with American accents ... might be fine for American audiences but for every other nation on the planet it sounds wrong and comes off as arrogant. There are many shows I'd like to watch but can't handle the terrible dubbing. (And sometimes subtitles are too difficult to follow being a bit dyslexic slow to read) ... surely it can't be that hard to find native speakers who can dub in English?
While I enjoy the app and watching my shows I wish Netflix would stop removing them. I was in the middle of watching the anime Fullmetal Alchemist when I opened the app and it was completely gone. No warning or anything. So Netflix please stop removing shows and add back all of the anime ones since I cannot find that anime anywhere else to watch.
"Having trouble sending Netflix from the app to the brand new Chromecast device connected to our TV. It just shows a screen that says the was a problem and to please try again, but the same thing keeps happening. Google Home app people are suggesting it's a Netflix app problem. Any suggestions to solve this?"
I've been using Netflix for years. But it's just not that I've encountered the videos that freezes every 2 minutes. Sometimes less than a minute. Or audio will continue but not the video. Looks like I'm not the only one having this issue. I already did every troubleshooting possible. My phone is also updated.
"the whole app got with every new feature buggier and worse. For example even in the homepage the app is almost crashing, every show or movie takes half of the screen and is loading automatically the trailer and the whole app is crashing. I want the old layout back where you have to tap on a show or movie to watch the trailer i dont want this nonsense, with this ""feature"" you are loosing subscribers i cant even use the app on my phone"
It's not good & not bad. Pls appload the new web series & multy languages üëÑüí¨most of we need english language. Pls dubbed in English.....
"Well, it's alright but it needs to update more often. I like some of the series they have on here but you have to wait forever for it to update. And when I type in something I want to watch, it will appear in the searched list but, when I click on it it's not there. I think that's some sort of bug that could be fixed. Above all it is a good time killer when needed."
The only reason we left cable was because streaming didn't have commercials. The app is fine I'm not paying extra.
"You need to switch the subtitles back to how it used to be, right now it's white text with white border and no background. I can't even see the subtitles that well cause there's too much white in the shows I'm trying to watch. Make it white text with black borders or black background, that way it doesn't blend into the video and we'll actually be able to see it."
"Needs more movies and shows (old and new). After 3 or 4 months you're best unsubbing for at least a few months to wait for some new titles. Also contacted CS about a series missing 8 whole episodes who told me it would ""probably appear the next week"" when it never did and no actual attempt to investigate and provide a solution was ever made."
Here's my main concern... if you're going to use image capture to verify human beings are posting payment to their account how about you use some photos that are in any way in focus. How am I suppose to tell if there is a car in a photo if it's so out of focus I don't know what it's of. By the third attempt there were three of us trying to figure out what a few of the photos even were. Other than that and the increased price for less things I actually want to watch the app is good.
"The cast button used to be on the home screen but can now only be accessed when a program or movie is selected....bit annoying. Way better to be able to cast as soon as the app opens. Another annoying issue is that everytime you remove something from the watch list, you're taken back all the way to the beginning of the watch list and have to scroll through again to get to where you were.."
"Netflix, in itself is nice. But the hectic sign up process is outrageous. You wouldn't believe how many times my virtual Mastercard (with which i make online purchases), has been blocked/banned. The website on chrome doesn't tell you the final payment amount. It just tells you the price of the package alone. Ignoring the taxes. Since i dont know how much the taxes are, the fee gets all jumbled up and it adds to the unsuccessful transactions list in my virtual card app. Please consider updating."
"How do we turn off the in app, red dot notifications? It's fine if it's notifying me of a show I wanted to be reminded about, but I don't want notifications asking if I'm enjoying a show, telling me to watch something again, or telling me about the dumb special collections that they have. Usually when I ask it to notify me when a show comes out I don't get the notification until days later and I've already figured out on my own that the show dropped."
"Lately since streaming has become competitive, Netflix's content has gone down. Big loss to me was ""Shameless"". Also, Netflix needs to have an icon to show movies that aren't in English. Lots of good content in foreign films, but don't understand, not do I feel like reading when I'm movie watching."
"Hello netflix. I loved watching tokyo ghoul, but after a few days of watching i started having problems with the app. Audio still playing and text on the right time, but the screen freezing. Or like black screen. It irritates me very much because i have already tried reinstalling it and it doesnt stop, please fix thisüòê."
"i love the app but movies that i have downloaded have disappeared and the app is letting me not download movies multiple times until next summer (next june/july) even if i have only downloaded it a couple of times in the past. a button to delete shows in the ""continue watching"" bar would not go a miss as there are plenty of thing i have started watching in which i have no care as to continue watching it... please fix these or get back to me soon. apart from these the app is great. thanks"
"this app has been around too long to be so AWFUL with recommendations. what happened? The recommended selection are in NO way based on viewing preferences or history, so what are they based on? Seems like it's based on what you want me to watch which makes me think there is a subpar selection. I use other services more now bc of this. Do better. Especially if you have the nerve to squabble over password sharing and increase rates."
Well... I like it. But... YouTube has better video quality than Netflix. The pictures are so pixelated even with a good network speed! Watching action movies is hard and irritating sometimes! I am kindda dissapointed! After all the good things I heard about it and the variety of genres there are for so many series and movies.
"Netflix is good. The app is good. But tell me again how it is necessary to show the HUD for EIGHT full seconds every time I happen to touch the screen. Clearly the design decisions are mindless, else the HUD wouldn't stay visible even after you hit the play button - the button that means ""I want to see the movie now!"""
"My issue with this application, are the lack of controls during playback. There is no reason not to have touch controls on either side and/or center. Volume up/down, seeking (center), brightness up/down. If netflix cannot create a better player they should allow playing in external players."
Some good movies but would like more options most of my favorite movies and TV shows are not on here or only available in the UK
"App does not work well when casting to Chromecast. Cannot control volume, play or pause in-app, subtitles turn on randomly and cannot be turned off without exiting and reopening the app, which cuts off the stream. It's a mess unless I want to watch on my phone only, which is almost never."
Frustrating! After 12 months of casting Netflix from my phone to 2 TV''s. I suddenly stopped being able to do this. I can still cast other apps from my old ipad to TV using chromecast so it's not chromecast. After 4 mths without Netflix (and still paying for it). No technical assistance has managed to sort this. Today I wasted another 90 mins in a chat room. It is so infuriating and trying to sort something over a cellphone chat.
The movies are ok but why is there no new movies. Love Netflix but they have to put more new movies.
"when watching for about 2-5 minutes it says ""error 5.7"" tried the steps to fix it, didn't work. tried clearing the cache, clearing all data, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, even talked to someone from Netflix and still not fixed, basically useless and yet every month I pay for the premium package. don't even bother with this, just a waste of my time and money"
I want to change my payment method but I can't figure out how! They make it so freaking hard. Netflix please make it easier to do this.
I use a shared account so I don't specifically pay for it but it has some good features like small window view where you can do other things on your phone while watching a show or whatever (for android). I know it's a tad expensive and I really hate the limited screen factor but besides that it's good for no ads and specific shows.
"I love Netflix personally, recently Netflix won't let me in the app it says that I have to try again but then I re-open it but nothing happens. That's why I give it 3 Stars. I would give it 5 Stars if it would work better for me, seriously. But then Netflix is the best platform to watch your favorite movies, TV shows and documentarys. I think it should be added that there is a place where you can see actors and see where they also play in it."
The last 2 updates have disabled my ability to download anything. I live in an area with no service so I really only use Netflix for this feature. It says that I don't have any storage left on my device and redirects me to upgrade my plan. I currently have one movie downloaded across all devices.
"I don't know know why there isn't any option to check the logged in devices, like the prime. Isn't that a basic thing to keep a track on our account. I don't know why the netflix is leaving these simple things that make the main user comfortable like de-registering the devices from the main acoount, like the prime. The shows and content are great but the UI is worst (Needs a lot more improvement). If u thought someone got access to ur account, you hav to sign out of all devices. can't continue"
"I found a glitch in this app where it will suddenly stop playing and prompt you with an error message to reload the app, only this time you will lose your widevine L1 cert and HD playback until you reinstall the app, neither erase all data of the app nor restart the phone will help. I'm using the Mi 9T, the device is capable of HD and HDR playback which is clearly listed on Netflix official website."
Use to love them had great selections now I have no idea what going on. They also don't give me the whole month of subscription I pay on the 1st and they always cut me off 1 or 2 days early. Called them and all they say is cancel and subscribe again and it will reset your payment date. Done it 3 times still the same problem. They just canceled it today the 30th. I'm not going to renew I'm going to stick with Hulu and the rest of the apps I have.
"Well, everything was great at first, for about 6 weeks or so then it started to freeze and kept telling me that they were having trouble with what ever I was watching and to try later or choose something else, (annoying) I thought ok things happen, then it got worse not just at prime time, 11o'clock a m. As well as around 3/4 onwards then again around 9p.m {very annoying). and then it crept into every day, I also had their best package. I'll just see this month out then no more."
"It's reliable (unless using a VPN). I use a VPN to protect my privacy and security online, and Netflix frequently tells me that it can't connect, while the rest of my apps/the Internet connection are working fine. If I turn off my VPN, Netflix suddenly works perfectly"
"Cast and 'remote' sync with Samsung TV is horrible. I can't get it to cast properly sometimes. Sometimes, it'll successfully cast & start playing on TV but the mobile app thinks it's not casting (no controls). Sometimes it can only cast if the TV app was not initially opened on the TV. Sometimes and really rarely, it'll just work. Everything else is great except this function"
Recently experiencing issues with Netflix remembering placemarkers in episodes watched. Will reset the placemqrker to the beginning and often play the video but the timer/countdown wont move. When this happens you cannot skip ahead either. Trying to uninstall and reinstall for the second time. See if that fixes the bug.
"I really did take a fancy to this app, it has anime, a decent collection of movies and exclusive shows like squid game (absolutely great). But the problem is the payment, We took a basic pack which is 199rupees, which should have been for 30 days but after 14 days it asks me to update payment and wanted me to take a 449 pack for a month . Which compared to other platforms is way too expensive, a hotstar VIP subsciption charges that much for a year. I decided to cancel the membership."
"Worked for a little while then suddenly started displaying error code -14 on startup and won't let me into the app. I have tried all troubleshooting suggestions, I have uninstalled and reinstalled, logged out and back in, cleared storage and cache but still getting the same error message. Very dissapointed as I would have like to use it for my long-haul flight. ***UPDATE I have been using the app after doing a powerwash on my device due to other issues, the app has been working fine since."
The lighting!! Horrible. Allow us to change the lighting through our own phone. It is too dark when it comes to scenes at night or even just lower light. Fix that issue!!! Our phone should be how we control it. Their app light should be just extra when it gets too dark
The UI and streaming quality is good though downloads do not work for me and customer support blamed my connection quality even though it gave me no feedback that downloads had failed. It just gets stuck and I have to restart. Downloads work find it apps like Amazon Prime so a company like Netflix should be able to fix this bug.
"It's okay. It's not the essential app it used to be. It's very expensive, compared to services like Disney, and there's no guarantee a show that you love will still be there tomorrow. I'm okay at the moment but if I needed to save money, this would be the first of the subscription services to go. Maybe if they spent less on making games no one wanted or asked for they could cancel less shows."
"I mostly enjoy my streaming experience on Netflix, but I am afraid I find the classics and world cinema collection of Netflix really poor (at least in the country I am streaming). It would be great to be able to watch more classics, maybe some more director collections, good examples from world cinema and maybe a screening chance for independent productions. I hope my comment can reach some people. :D Thanks."
I like this app it is a good app but there are many issues and my biggest one is the shows. You guys dont make good shows and if you do you cancel them instantly because of not enough views maybe if you add a second season and then it doesnt get views then you can stop production on the show. Example: Lockwood and Co it has a great beggining but at the end there are so many mysteries and possibilities with the show if you added a second season i think it would get enough views. Please consider
"I have not downloaded the app yet, i do however hav Netflix on my pc, and in terms of variety and so forth i love it, what upsets me though, and i do not know if this is relevant on this platform, but the NEW movies and series are very limited, i initial got netflix 2 years ago, and when i started using it again last week, they had many of the same movies i watched then still with a ""new tag"" by them,, im not really seeing anything new"
"Why it happanf like this when the membership stopped it will say your payement is pending sometime wher should we payyyyy?? Beeginers don,t know sometimes whend we do membership we need to pay two times whyy?? When we pay one time it will ushally fail to go and our money will go for nothing plssss change thisüôèüôè"
"I love this app! Seriously i do! I'd give it a 5 but ik not going to there is a serious issue going on its getting stuck at 25% on my tv it wont go any further so, Netflix please work on this It's an amazing app i can watch anime and so much more. To be honest at first me and my father were like ""Netflix has the best vid player!"" And the moment we opened it the 25 percent thing started Netflix please resolve this issue"
"Just so many chav films, too much reality rubbish. Not enough older films, in fact, not enough film genre choice at all. Some subscribers were born before 1999, it would be nice if films reflected this. Also, on the screen it looks like there are 100s of different films, yet n reality there's just so much cross over in the separate genres. Some of us like old black and white films, old old comedy, not the rubbish shown today."
"Ok. It would be 5 stars if they had more than just the phone call option for problems the help centre can't help with. I do know that they have a live chat but it had disappeared and is harder to find. The first times my problem help was able to easily find the live chat. The second to last time, it was way harder to find the live chat but found. This time I cannot find the live chat anywhere."
"Excellent most of the time. Some series are set for audio in multiple languages, and then half way through the series revert to only one language. After multiple complaints there has been no change to this very annoying glitch. Shame on Netflix - had believed the streaming platform was better than this!"
"No kannada movies, will return when there is kannada cinemas and separate kannada category."
Shows are awesome. But I'm having problems with sounds. Video is playing but there's no sound. I tried to do everything. updating to chack sound system. Sometimes i have to restart my phone to watch shows with sound. Please resolve this situation.
"I would give Nextflix 5 stars if they didn't have so much of their content canceled with dangling endings. They try out a lot of shows, often very good, and don't follow through on them. I'm just getting tired of picking up a new show on Netflix, liking it, and find it got canceled mid-story. I'd prefer less content that gets proper endings. So 3/5 stars on that point primarily."
"I feel like there are less interesting movies to watch. Not worth the money I'm paying, honestly lol."
"I think netfix is a great app for most things but I do have a comeplant, because there are a few shows where there are more seasons but it only shows the first few seasons. It also will put on some great movies and shows but then after just a month or so will take them off."
"I'd like ability to disable the games showing it just clutter the screen and are irrelevant to me. Spanish Netflix sometimed for shows that are in different language will not show the English subtitles only Spanish, even tho in English speaking countries the Eng. subs will show."
The app is great problem is the content...Even if you switch to English settings most content will be in a foreign language despite their descriptions being in English. Like why bother just remove the content that has no subtitles üòï I live in Korea by the way amd heavy on the Anime most of which I watched in S.A but when I moved no more subtitles for the exact same shows like why????!!!!!
Application is not working fine. Over fire stick while playing some content it's restarting again and again while some other content is playing smooth. I'm using it over the mobile application as well and could see the application crashing multiple times.
When I turn off and leave the app and come back. The whole screen of my show turns black and only the sounds come out and subtitles show. I find annoying to have it through multiple episodes. Other than that everything is great.
"It's a nice app to watch movies but! The movie you watch/ or you want to watch, it matter where you liveüò± it's really sad and Netflix needs to fix this it is sad for some people who may want to watch demon Slayer but they are in Australia I live in Australia and it doesn't pop up so please fix this Netflix and especially we really need to make sure that Netflix isn't going to do this, bye!"
"impossible to play pip on motorola edge 40 neo - yes, pip is enabled, restarting phone etc.. also done."
"I have had Netflix, on and off, for some eleven years. It is ok to have. I can only say, ""Now that the rich have picked our carcass to the bone, they are going to force us to watch their advertisements."" Netflix and Amazon were a decent escape from the Hell the elite have made for us, but they are just another oppressive intrusion anymore. It is not enough for these entities that we have paid all these years to make them who they are today. They coldly ""thank"" our loyalty with commercials."
"When trying to watch Netflix in the smaller floating window while using other apps lately Netflix keeps randomly closing itself completely, sometimes multiple times per episode,& jumps back to the point I started at when I reopen it making it difficult to watch anything&the autoplay keeps going back to several episodes ago or even over a season ago randomly instead of going to the next episode, trying to replay episodes I've JUST watched making the autoplay almost useless. Please fix this"
Changed prices very fast and won't let me change my settings back to single use instead of 2 watching. Not ok for the price charged. It's as expensive as MAX and not that great quality of shows.
You'd think after raising the price on service that the app would work better. But that's definitely not the case. Not sure whats going on with netflix but they really need to fix the problems!
"Initially it started out well, but then the app would stop and freeze during different shows until it just stopped playing the video altogether. The audio is fine and very good, it's just the video that's giving me problems"
I expected better from an app I'm paying monthly for. On the TV it works fine but everytime I'm watching on my phone the screen would freeze while audio keeps playing. I have to go back to the home screen in order to fix it but it'll continue happening several times. It gets pretty annoying.
"This app has always been the best but since a few days ago after updating it, it is always slow when I try to view a movie or series it takes forever to load where as before I would view anything anytime without any problem."
"It has multiple accounts but one can watch Netflix fix that problem, that's all but you have nice movies and series but sunflix has your movies and series also only in Netflix movies and series, it's free to watch so you need to upgrade your stats"
"Service and all is great but seems like you're missing some basic features. For example why is there no ""watched"" tab? Or why is ""my list"" not sorted by the time something was added there for easier management but apparently by some random rule. Small stuff but it makes experience really worse."
"Netflix seemed too be s good app at first but mist of the movies that I search for aren't on it ,the app only had a limited number of movies and series' some series don't even completetation of all the seasons other than this tr app is pretty great and doesnt lag most of the time"
I've just paid my subscription last week and I can't download nor watch any thing from the app. Its just blank... please fix this
This app is great. There are two things that I would like to suggest which will improve upon watching experience. 1. Add a long press to mark episode or movie as played. There was a tv show which I watched season 1 from some place else but watched season 2 on Netflix. It show season 1 episode in my continue to watch tab. 2. Automatically remove movies and tv shows from the watch list when finished. I hope some reads this. Mostly feedbacks are ignored when a company gets this size.
"The app works well for playing Netflix. The issue is that I have noticed on my device that if I let the app run in the background by not actually closing it before doing something else on my phone, it drains about as much battery as my screen being on. Which places it as the 1st or 2nd greatest battery hog on my phone"
I am giving a 3 stars because am so pissed off right now. I noticed when I logged in with another phone goes to my page.... I will not see my downloaded movies... Unless I go back to the previous phone I used earlier.. Some times the downloaded movies/series will be there anymore. Now Netflix isn't opening on the phone I usually download on. This is the second time am experiencing this.... Pls kindly look into this. I
"There's three issues, one being that when i pause my movie or series, go into another app and come back to play my thing it freezes for a little while but still continues audio to a forwarded scene I haven't seen yet, second being that when watching a series and then resuming it, Netflix does not take me to the right episode, it takes me to one I've already seen, third is that I'm currently playing the minecraft story mode, it freezes, when i re-enter it, i have to restart my choices."
We've had account for Netflix for over 6 yrs and once upon a time we loved it with all the variety of old and new movies but the past year it's been horrible with the variety unless you count all the ones that sound really good until you go to watch it and it's in another language grrrrrr that's a game changer Netflix needs to go back to the way it use to be soon
Netflix is really good and it has lots of shows and movies that are really nice to watch. the only downside that I absolutely HATE is that Netflix brings in soooo many Netflix originals and take away all of the good movies and TV shows. There is only a handful of Netflix originals that people actually watch but the rest are just waste. there is so many movies and shows that I used to watch on Netflix but I cant anymore because they took them all away
Unable to view Downloads list while online in the latest update
"Its a great app. However, it would be nice if I can make the screen of netflix smaller on mobile and I can do other things while streaming. And you should update the app whenever search for movies it shows a little list of movies but there are a lot of movies on netflix."
"So far, its working perfectly. but, whenever i try watching a movie/series. It just shows me a black screen which covers the whole movie. it didn't do this last month, but now it chose to do it. i lost count of my episodes because it completely restarted everything for me. im very disappointed right now, but i hope anyone could help me. because im still paying. and it might seem like its a scam and I don't want any trouble with the company. i just want to know why it isn't lettin me watch."
"The app works neatly, but there are a few things that I really would like to see added: Please add a feature that you get a push notification about a week before something in your list is removed from Netflix. Very often things I plan to watch suddenly disappear. More features like a list of all liked movies or more customization of your feed would be awesome too."
"In the popup that appears when we click on a movie, I would suggest the addition of an icon to add the movie/series into watchlist. It would also be nice if there is an option to customize the whole app or atleast the icons in the video player(option to customize the forwarding time from 10sec to 5sec). It would be nice if there is a plan like ""2 devices at a time(only mobile and no casting)"" or ""1 device at a time(with casting option)"". Try to consider these features in the next update"
"The ""performance improvements"" and the ""bug fixes"" in the last update broke the playing from download functionality. You can no longer use the buttons or even rotate the screen when playing anything from the downloads. How could you guys miss this?"
"I got this app over one show since I was unable to watch it anywhere else. The show was ""Miraculous tales of ladybug and cat Noir"" I was told that it has 5 seasons of it so I assumed that the 5th season was probably the movies or trailers for it. Yeah No Netflix only has 3 seasons of it and Season 2 and 3 are spilt in Half just to make it seem like they have the seasons."
This app is great but I do want to say that the amount of unfinished anime series are starting to get old. For example haikyu has had at least 2 or 3 more seasons and you guys don't have them out not to mention the fact that there is plenty of others like Sao and one piece. Love the app but really hate this one part I hate have to go on a wild goose chase to finish an anime.
I liked when the service was 7.99 ....now im not liking the price raise...still good for those movies and shows for the moment i guess
"Best app for streaming by far. But I really don't understand why when you buy the right for a new movie you forget to get the trailer!? Trailer is the main deciding factor for spending a couple of hours of my life on a movie. When you don't add trailer, I go to watch it on YouTube and sometimes I get distracted and never come back to Netflix. So please consider adding trailer for every movie or show you have."
Ive read reviews and Im not updating my app until things are fixed. Ive only had this a month and am having trouble streaming from my tablet to my chromecast. It keeps saying connection lost or something along those lines. Pls fix WE LOVE the Netflix original shows. (Those are the only good thing about this app so far.) Pls fix.
"Ui need some improvement, and filter option should be fixed like add year released or more specific genres"
"Great experience, love the thrill of just being connected on the latest tv shows and drama series."
Ok so the app is basically the same as the tv Netflix but the biggest and only problem is that it doesn't have the same shows as it does on the tv. For example if im watching a new show on Netflix on my tv and I search for it on the phone app its not there. So basically some of the shows are outdated and the shows that should be there are not.
Netflix is great but not happen with ANOTHER price increase!? May start looking elsewhere sooner than later. movie selection has gone way down in the last year. Every movie now is a Netflix Origanal!? What's up with all these foreign movies with subtitles? WARNING. You may need to learn a new language to watch Netflix for now on! Lol. Looks like Netflix won't be number 1 much longer. I have been with them since day 1. Time to leave Netflix.
Good app and content. Get rid of (or allow us to disable) the stupid brightness adjuster as it as easier and better adjusting screen brightness from phone. Once you use it on the app you no longer have the option to do it from your phone. I have to keep uninstalling it to reset it.
"It s an ok streaming service,but the inability to watch everything you desire,that is also in the Netflix s range is disappointing. It s sad that some parts of the world have some movies/anime but others don't ,I find it quite stupid. I stopped paying because of that,cause I'm mostly watching anime,and most of the anime that I'm watching are unavailable to me,but available to other world locations. I'll start using it again when we'll get everything we want to watch. After all,we pay the same."
Disappointed and can hardly watch Netfix anymore as its usually before bed. Problem that is so frustrating is when I fall asleep watching a series and I wake up hours later and Netfix is still playing and through so many episodes wastes my no actually steals my data and I need to find where I left off. What frustrates me more is when I'm awake watching it skipping intros and stuff it pauses and askes me are you still there? Been watching other sites before bed till this is fixed.
"Weird technical glitch happening. On my pixel 3 xl, when I pause, leave the app for a bit, then go back and press play, a long glitch line appears on the screen that moves from left to right. Happens about every minute or so. I have to shut everything down and restart the Netflix app for it to go away."
After watching a few months i realise most of the movie is an old movie only a few is new movie. But now i cant even open any movie. It bring me to error everytime i choose a movie. Then i sign out and now i cant sign it. It keep denying n said password is wrong.. WTH :( i hope Netflix can fix whatever bug is disturbing.. whats the use if i continuing pay the subscription fees n get this kind of crab error...thank you.
This app use to be good till recently now my titles don't show up at all with title covers can't tell what I'm attempting to watch till I tap it on my android app from Google play store it also bumps me off every few while playing and has other issues too. 3 stars for now but will edit if it fixes if not will lower my rating till app becomes useable again.
Your GTA trilogy isn't compatible for my Infinix Zero 5g although you said the requirements are android OS8 or above.... Even the old GTA is playable and yours? What a disappointnent.
"It is one of the best and the most expensive apps that is available in India to stream online content... I've been using it for a few months now and sometimes it feels the Indian subscribers are being over charged... because a lot of online content that is available in the US is not available in India territory, due to territorial distribution copy rights. There are services available out there like Amazon prime or Hotstar that are cheaper and fairly good when compared to Netflix."
"Its Nice! But it doesn't let me delete some shows i dont like from ""Continue Watching for ( )"". When you have a download it doesn't let you skip the intro like when you have wifi. Also whenever I see a movie I love and plan to watch it THEN they take it down from the WEBSITE!"
Over the past six months I have experienced times where the audio would continue to play but the visual would freeze up for like 10 to 20 seconds. It does this quite often during a show or at extreme moments while watching an action movie. Please fix this issue. Thanks.
my husband and i are currently debating on getting rid of Netflix. Netflix is removing all the decent movies and shows to make room for their Netflix originals. plus they are uping the price to show their own stuff . Netflix's hardly ever puts new kids movies in. Plus Everytime we play a movie it switches to a different language. my 3 stars is for having all the seasons of Greys Anatomy.
"Used to watch Netflix after my work hours but recently I am not able watch any shows, as when I start to watch something it get loading and nothing comes after but just a screen loading for long , if it is continuing there no way that I am going to pay for next month subscription it will be a total waist if I am just paying to see all shows just get loading it doesn't make any sense. Please fix this error ASAP. Thankyou"
The shows keep freezing. Sometimes audio will continue sometimes not. But when the show freezes I never see the buffer sign or a loading circle. It's been happening often these past two weeks. Hopefully uninstalling the reinstalling will fix? If not y'all need to start looking for the bug
"Why does the app have it's own brightness setting? Phones themselves have the ability to toggle brightness built-in, but for some reason, Netflix feels the need to have a seperate brightness slider. What makes this so annoying is that it doesn't go as low as my phones brightness slider either, and it always overrides my phones brightness settings, so it just feels like my eyes are being assaulted whenever I want to watch at night."
"I have to use an overlay app on my Honor 8X because the touch digitiser is damaged. The app effectively disables a selected area of the screen from touch input but I think this is affecting the Netflix app. Whenever I go to watch something on it, I experience a black screen with audio in the background. Is there any fix for this?"
"I choose the highest plan for all devices but yet I cannot connect to my smart TV or my laptop it say in bold (Watch Netflix on your phone or tablet - get it free in app) please fix this issue, if I'm not able to watch it on TV or at least my laptop then there's no point to have it (also I tried cast screen, it doesn't work, only audio plays, video is on the phone)."
"I would really like to be able to note what I have already seen, and filter these out of the search results and suggestions. A little like Audible? To make it even better, if I look at something and definitely don't want to watch it then it would be great to be able to note that too and filter that out of suggestions as well. These ideas would make finding something to watch a much quicker and less laborious and repetitive. The menus would be much more useful."
"everything was ok till i changed my phone. in my earlier samsung i could screen cast downloaded movies on to TV through chromecast. now from my new phone (incidentally samsung again) when i cast from mobile onto tv only sound and controls appear but content cannot be seen. (i download when i get free wifi, hence this is important to me). suugest any fix? else its a dealbreaker for me.."
"For some unknown reason when I'm playing a downloaded video or even streaming, the Netflix App forces my phone to restart. I googled this issue online and discovered that a LOT of other users too are facing the same bug. It's very frustrating. Fix it with an update, this honestly ruins the entire Netflix experience."
"The app is really decent unless you have any networking setup apart from the standard home internet, changes in network and especially a VPN even if it's set to your home country will essentially nullify the apps ability to function, some clarity as to what's happening and how to fix it is entirely void, you're simply left to either figure out what is triggering the almighty Netflix DRM or wait until it decides to work again. Also can't change video quality which sucks."
"After the last update, the app crashes immediately after entering the app. I unistalled, then reinstalled. It worked! But again the next day this problem occured. And im from South Asia, there are many movies and shows that aren't available in the region.. Can you please solve these issues?"
These are all major issues with Netflix application. -Subtitles covering the entire screen some times. Which are not transparent. -There should be options for adjusting the subtitles according to user. -No seperate volume increase option for Netflix application. -Subtitles lightning is dominanting video at night time. -Zoom in and zoom out screen is required.
Love it but some of the shows/movies/anime are leaving soon üò≠üò≠üò≠
"Worst... Even if i subcribe maximum benifit plan, it not showing in full hd in mobile. I can detect the difference btw 480p,720p & 1080p... Don't make us fool.... I do have high speed internet connection Edited: despite having widevine l1 certification, it was showing L3. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it worked... However this should not be the case.. Why this error..."
"Not playing videos, just showing loading every time. Can anyone tell what's the problem???? Same issue agan. üò†"
"When it wants to work, it's great. Had no issues with Netflix on my galaxy s8. I'd mirror my screen to my TV and watch it that way. Now that I have a note 9, it messes up way more, which doesnt make sense being that it's a better phone."
"Went through mths of not being able to add films to my list. In the end, I phoned them, and was told that you have a limit of 200 movies (I ""think"" it was 200, I can't remember now). The system doesn't let you add any more if you've come to your limit, but it doesn't tell you about the limit, or how many films you've added!! Was advised to split my list up under different profiles. Today, I have the opposite problem. I can't delete films! Phoned up, to no avail. Way too expensive too!"
"Almost no 4K uhd movies, some series. 2019 approaching, still lack of UHD Movies?? BUG in subtitles, many times deutch or other language only, in subtitle. Take many attempts to change to English. Increase of dubbed movies. Seriously! Settings lacks many options. I have no interest in children or family movies, why cant settings have this option. And no interest in dubbed movies and non english movies. Why no option to exclude these?"
"Loads of room for improvement - can we please have a full list of each category by alphabetical order (e.g. Korean drama, British movies, etc); remove anything on the ""continue watching"" column that we longer want to watch; more customisation in ""My List"" like sorting by year, genre, alphabetical etc, possibly let us group the way we wanted (YouTube is doing a very good job on that); and a list for the videos are soon leaving Netflix."
It's a great app but it's extremely annoying how hard it is to find any good movies or shows anymore because they keep removing ALL of the actual GOOD movies. It's pretty disappointing because what's the point of paying for it when there's nothing good to even watch. There's better movies and shows on tubi which is all FREE.
"I like having the option to watch tv and movies. But I think it is a bit difficult to navigate. I would like to see info/description on everything before I watch it. And ratings on everything too. And some tv series don't have even the last season, they are behind for 3 or 4 seasons. I think that my rating of a show should be on a scale of 1-5, , not just a yes or no. That's all. ;/"
"Too bad, some series have no English translation .. like the Chinese , none most of it have no English translation"
"I take back what I said: after a few months this app hasn't really been that bad compared to other streaming sites. They still have the same problem where there's still A LOT of unavailable movies here but those which are available is really enjoyable, not all tho some are really lame and boring. I just wish that you can add more here since we really spend lots of money just for this app."
After the last update the in-screen player (a mini player so you can keep watching the content while using others apps) is not longer working. If i do the same gest it just exits completely the app. Please take back this feature. Update 02/16/2022 Since last update i haven't been able to play anything at all. It always returns a network error and my internet connection is good...
"Don't get me wrong i like Netflix, but what gets on my wick with Netflix is the fact they air the 1st season of things then cancel them! WHY!? There are probably a fair amount of people all over the world who actually want to see the follow up seasons to those programmes, me included! Leaving things on a cliffhanger or cancelling through a season is not good at all from a subscribers point of view! Yeah I get all the viewing percentages etc, but some programmes take a season to get in to!"
"Great shows for the most part, can always find something to watch. Can you please make it easier to take shows out of your ""continue watching"" list. Nothing frustrates me more than seeing a ton of shows I dont want to continue watching in there. I have to scroll through garbage to find ones I actually want to watch. Change it please!"
"Everything was fine until the latest updates were installed, now I am unable to access anything from my tablet. A free trial screen shows and if I can get Netflix everywhere else in the home why do I need to sign up or enter sign in info again. I checked box to remember sign in and now it does not automatically sign."
"Netflix has always been a fairly priced and excellent streaming service its biggest flaw is and always has been its selection. Over the time that I've used it some my favorite shows have even been removed, however it is still worth while to look through and see if anything catches my intrest or to come back to shows I've watched before."
"This service just got too expensive. I felt they are taking advantage of their viewers by jacking the prices up right in the middle of a global pandemic! Knowing we are mostly trapped in our homes and Netflix has become a decent provider for movies - but NOW it's just over the top expensive in my opinion, thus I discontinued service. Get back to reasonable price without cutting out the better / best movies - a trick they seem to enjoy! Give us full access at a price under $10, be a team player"
"Would be a 5 star if there was an option for using WiFi or data for ""smart downloads."" Where I visit sometimes, ther is no wifi and only an option for Data. Smart download won't work with data and there is no option for you to choose. Should at least be that for more convenience."
"Alot of other people have had the same issue as me. When i go out of netflix and do something else on other apps, netflix starts playing in the background and it is extreemly annoying. Sometimes when i switch my phone off it carries on playing and if i had earphones in i wouldnt realise yntil i go onto the movie/show i was watching and its either finished or its on a part i hadnt left it on.üö®PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUEüö®"
"The app is fine, 5 stars. However, Netflix's streaming service itself is bad. They hardly ever have movies and TV shows that I search for, and most of the shows that I do find have episodes and/or complete seasons missing. For that, they get 1. That averages out to a 3."
"This new interface design of Netflix mobile app is beyond worst. They wanted to make it like other social media Instagram or Snapchat or something I absolutely don't know. But an ott platform's interface shouldn't be like this. It's a big flaw of the developer or whoever thought to make it that way. Please change it as soon as possible and make the interface design to the old and develop on that only, but this is what it is now it beyond worst. It feels like a black colour Snapchat app."
"Functionally this app is stellar. content wise, absolutely subpar. ""Netflix"" used to be synonymous with lower than cinema grade but is still very competent flicks that is worth your time in addition to vast catalogue of movies to watch. Nowadays ""netflix"" series conjures a motion picture of less than stellar quality in my mind that sells shock value and gimmicks rather than quality in addition to decreasing number of catalogues. Im reconsidering my subscription in a year if things do not improve"
"Had this streaming platform for a few years, honestly, it seems like the movie selections have become weak, and the viewing options presented, are throw backs. With that in mind, the price for the platform has increased several times. Netflix, I give you a 3 star rating at this time."
Hard to find items. My list keeps shuffling. Why can't you add filter with leaving soon in one place and list alphabetically. I seem to spend most of my time just scrolling.
"I am premium customer but 90 percent movies are not there when you are searching for it. It is very expensive as compare to other application like discovery, hotstar, zee5, Amazon Prime I have all these app. And I usually end up watching the rest since there are more movies, episode, live, anime available on them than on Netflix. They have so limited and it's absurd it is so expensive."
"Will not say which movie is captioned, subtitled or dubbed. Movies and Shows cannot be filtered by a certain length of time. When I want to watch a twenty minutes of something, I want to be able to go to Shows to choose a film that long. If I want to watch something 90 minutes or a 2 minutes short film, then I want to go to Movies and choose something that long. Right now I have to open each thumbnail and search the time I desire. Hassle. App is very useful in isolation of life when internet on"
"The new ""Digest"" tab is the worst feature Netflix has ever added. It used to just show you upcoming titles that would be added soon. Now it shows you that, plus a bunch of additional ""memes"", as if you're scrolling through Netflix's social media. I wouldn't care about this addition if I could disable the social media style posts so I wouldn't have to sift through them to try and see what's actually going to be added. Otherwise an alright app."
"Even right after updating it half the time I'm on mobile I'll try to load something to watch but it'll either leaving me on loading the whole time or give me an error, this even applies to things I've downloaded. The only way I can het it to work again is to restart my phone everytine. I dont have this problem on other platforms so I dont know if its Netflixs fault or my phone but other streaming apps work which doesnt make sense."
"The quality is great and there are a few awesome shows... but what's with all these lame movies?? we are paying each month to continue using Netflix, it should be actually updated each month. Instead of just adding 2 or 3 random movies from 4 years ago...i know Netflix could be so much better on this side of the world!"
"Seriously. . Not to be like that.. But I am Italian/American and there is barely anything of what I watch on this app. Have to re-watch very few things when I'm done watch it once, Because the alternative kinda sucks. you gotta start be more open minded to add more movies/tv-shows then just same old same old but different names that is literally boring."
I can play the app on my phone and I have updated the app on my PS4 but it will not play I have checked all my settings on my PS4 and everything is good. I would give this a five-star rating but Netflix needs to correct this issue for the PlayStation networks. If this issue continues I will either cancel my subscription or go to a different movie network.
OTT series are good. But stop promoting your games.
"I would have given 5 /5 if you guys just add a volume feature slider the same way you have a brightness slider as it makes the experience better. Apart from that the app is flawless, and one issue I face is the load time is very long, the app is suddenly unresponsive, the reason which is unknown."
"I guess the app is very nice, a lot series and movies to see but they have chance 2 things. 1 thing - I option to note see the entrance from series, I dont know the exactly word but is when the series start and after few minuts come a call showing the actors and whats the series is about. 2 thing - new movies and series, I dont know exactly which one but some new, some interesting and something old in the same time"
"I loved this app until today. Now, every time I pause a video, it makes log back in when I go to play it again. Absolutely useless unless you plan on being a zombie and watching Netflix and never responding to your surroundings. Not sustainable for actual people"
"After updating the app, it is not rotating..looks like it has been set to portrait mode only. Others apps are rotating fine so , i can say my device does not have problem. Also for confirming this issue, i tried to rotate on 4 mobiles but all goesin vain. Pls fix asap. Nobody wants to pay 800 per month for viewing in small scale."
"Last week i can adjust the brightness while watching movies on netflix. But now, the brightness level is stuck at low and it is very dark to watch the movie.. Please help. I unable to adjust it back. The bar for brightness adjustment is not there anymore... Tq"
"5*****This software always works no matter how screwed up a device, hardware, monitor etc are...truly amazing. 2** SEARCHING for unseen Trying to find using the various search options to watch or getting suggestions are poor and dependent on your ratings. No INMB ratings, suggesting shows in weird languages, no CC options etc.... IE TUBI eze to find something never seen before."
Application has loads of bugs. 1. It cant track my watch timelines properly when im watching one after another episode it wont recognize that i have finished watching previous episode. 2. Sometimes when i press home button when video is playing and after sometimes when i go back to netflix it gives me force close error repetetively.
"The app it self works great! We need more movies. Every time I get into a good Netflix series they end it, most end within 1 to 3 seasons. I'm getting to the point I don't even want to watch Netflix series anymore. I have been watching other apps more. I hope they fix that or Netflix maybe a service I drop."
"netflix used to work buttery smooth before i took the mobile plan. before i buy the mobile plan,i was using the standard plan which were available . since i have started mobile subscription,only dialogue are play and picture is not at all visible . only dialogue are playing in background with black screen. but this problem is not occuring when i play preview . previews are working fine ,but if i start playing any episode or film,this problem is occurring ."
"I use this app all day, every day. It used to be great and the prices were good. Now the prices keep going up and up and up BUT the quality of the app is going down. It shuts down on me then starts over for no reason at least once a day, sometimes more. Then when I want to fast forward, rewind, or pause what I'm watching it delays on the command that I give it. I don't know what's going on but with what I'm paying none of this should happen!"
"Mostly polished but hss issues staying stopped when it's supposed to. For example if I stopped watching and then use a Google assistant command later, whether on my phone or on Google assistant, Netflix will subsequently start playing in the background. Only way to stop it is to use the recent apps button and close it from there. Recently it also continues to play in the background when I answer phone calls."
"It would be nice if subtitles could include lyrics and other small details. Or the option to add your own subtitles It's good to have existing anime or filmography updates that are consistent with the local area. It's delayed a bit too much now. More animations, movies to watch. Don't have too many regional restrictions. Please."
Remeber our choices- its getting very frustrating having to keep turning off subtitles or changing the language because every episode reverts back to english audio and subtitles on and i want to just be able to click next episode and it carry on with the same settings like if i watch in spanish without subtitles the next episode will start spanish too - thank you
"It's a really good app to watch a lot of things however I recently noticed that I can't minimise my screen anymore so I can do things while having whatever I'm watching play in the corner of my screen. I'm mostly upset about this because whenever I watch something I also do something else like play a game, which is unfortunate because I can't do that anymore unless I watch Netflix on another device. Otherwise the app is really good and I haven't got anything else agains it. üòä"
"Prior to some updates sometimes last year, I can cast my screen to see movies on the app on my TV. That option is gone! Now, You only hear audio on the cast screen, video does not show. Please restore this function, at least for the kids' sake. I hope you give this some thoughtfulness."
"Please fix bug. This only happens in the following scenario, but it is so frequent, annoying and consistent. I pause a show and my phone screen goes to sleep. When I go to resume it, the screen is pure black but the sound is still playing. Then I have to close the app wait a few minutes and then it goes back to normal. Anyone else experience this?"
Hi Netflix I love the App the only thing is that I wish that my list of things I like appear on the menu(I don't wanna be hours swiping right till I find the one I wanted to watch )also the genre in the menu need to be more specific if that could be more easy to do I would give 5 stars for sure ! (This is my review for the computer version )
"Updated review! Why oh why can't the episodes stay in full screen mode?!!!! Stop tweaking what's not broken, let the episodes remain in fullscreen with subtitles switched off please!!!!!!!! Nice app with great shows and TV shows...... However, PLEASE CAN WE HAVE THE OPTION TO KEEP THE SUBTITLES TOTALLY OFF WHEN PLAYING THE NEXT EPISODE OR MOVIE....... Its very annoying to keep putting it off on every next episode or movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Watching subbed shows is not a good experience. Especially anime! due to extremely poor subtitles design. I almost watch all the anime which are already available on Netflix on other subscriptions just because of this. Guys take a cue from Amazon prime implementation of subtitles. It is not large nor very distracting yet visible on all light as well as dark backgrounds.
"All though the app is awesome and stuff but while I started watching a show, tvd aka The Vampire Diaries the best show, but yeah as I started to watch thatit was going great and all until it started freezing at random, I thought I needed to update it but updating didn't do anything, it started to flicker on and off, I got frustrated, then when I tried watching it again a few minutes ago the screen went fully pitch black but the sound was still going through"
"This app has always been great,however recently what has been bugging me is that programs are cut short before the end and a trailer plays. I wish you could stop the trailer playing at the end so I can see the end of the episodes. Incredibly frustrating!"
Currently have loading problem.have to wait for long time. Cannot access Netflix from my tab. Please fix ASAP
"Awhile ago, I keep having problems signing in, it keeps telling me about network error or my time is not accurate etc. Some of my downloads are empty , trying to fix the issue by restarting the app but won't solve the problem. After I updated the app from it's latest version, problem comes one after another and its very disappointing."
"great app, great shows! thing is, i've been watching food wars, im on episode 8. but everytime i open it on the netflix app, it starts back from episode one, or goes back a few episodes, and if it does stay on the same episode i was on when i closed the app, it goes back 10 minutes. its confusing and i end up watching several episodes realizing ive already watched them. please fix this."
"Runs fine on phone and tablet. However, the Netflix app for the Sony Playstation will not allow controller power to be shut off without stopping playback completely. It's an unnecessary drain on controller power, and one that can easily be remedied, but has not been for at least 3 years. Hence 3 stars."
From last three weeks my Netflix is not really opening it closes immediatelyas I try to open it....i have to uninstall and then install it again to use it works for few days and then again the problem starts and it's only this app with problem rest all my apps are working fine and moreover your movies are really old and you don't really have latest movies I see my 800 take monthly is nothing but waste
It would be great if there was a list A-Z of all the movies Netflix has available instead of making me have to go through different genres and keep looking at the same movies over and over. Because I usually just switch to watching something on Amazon Prime if I can't find something fast enough
Please fix your audio on your shows I have my chrome book on blast and I could bearly hear anything out of it when I'm watching movies and shows. it sounds like it wwas on medium low audio than a maxed out audio. This needs to be fixed ASAP. Please please fix your audio issuses its been weeks that it goes from very good to very bad in a instant after a couple of episodes in and half an hour during movie time. I just want to hear my shows and movies without this type of problem ever again.
"well Netflix is okay, but it doesn't have too many anime shows and that's preferably what I want to watch, but other than that it's okay also Netflix if you can respond to this I canceled my free subscription for the 30 day free trial literally like 2 minutes ago so it says my subscription will end on July 12th but my free 30-day trial only goes until July 11th so if you end up charging me for one day even after I canceled the subscription way before the deadline we're going to have a problem"
I screencast the app to my tv from my phone. I can watch some shows and moves other things I can't. Went to watch altered carbon season 2 the first episode it played the recap and when it went to the play the show it went black. I could see it on my phone but not the tv. The play and pause showed up on the tv. But not the show.
It's good but there needs to be more detail in searching and in categorizing. For example TV shows with just one season should be separated from other TV shows with multiple seasons canceled shells with one season should be separate from other shows with one season that are still coming out with more seasons.
"Your app is no longer working on my Samsung phone. If I play a movie the screen goes dark but I can still hear voices. I updated the app and still the same, I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it and now I can no longer login because apparently password I have been using for a longtime is no longer correct and the same password my siblings are using and no issues. They even logged out and logged in again with the same password and email your app is telling me it's incorrect. Fix this please"
There content is shriveling. While they attempt to squeeze more from there customers and it's pushing many away. I find myself now and then looking elsewhere. Given a reason I might move on. Movie studios strive to give the best picture yet Netflix attempts to squeeze $3 out of the customer to provide that best picture. This is some of the worst ways to treat a customer.
"Annoying UI. Dear Netflix, please move the ""Continue to Watch"" section to the TOP or make it the FIRST thing users see, OR allow users to move and edit those cards on their own (what order they want them to be in). I don't want to see 4 or 5 other categories before I can find what I'm truly looking for. It's annoying. Your users should be first, not an annoying UI or your algorithm üòï."
Ok. I hate that I can't watch while downloading The amazing feature that allowed me to have the miniscreen while i used other apps disappeared. It kinda sucks now. Really. But then again netflix is dope bring back the miniscreen feature. Edit----brought back the miniscreen‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èAllow me to download while watching on Netflix... . Thanks.
It's the best streaming app for me but recently I've been experiencing problems evrytime I try to use. I open it and it always says that there's a connection error while my other apps are all functioning well with the internet. It's built in app on my phone so i cant uninstall and install again. I dunno if the problem's my phone or not but I'm having a hard time with it. I'm hoping this gets fixed if the problem's within the app.
"There is a lot off issues with this app I just updated it yesterday when it would say ""there are too many downloads on this device"" when I only have about 30 downloads. 7GB worth downloads just mysteriously removed themselves or says it needs to be downloaded again. When I'm not connected to the internet,episodes which I have watched only a few minutes say expired, basically it wants me to have an internet connection at all times."
"It would have been much better if we had the below features in the app. 1. There should be simple sort option in the app. Sort by Year, Name and so on.. If we select Hindi and if there is sort by year option then it would have been very much simpler for me to search movies. 2. Simple Filter options like, Filter by actor, actress, director and so on."
Great streaming service and plenty of things to watch from series to movies however the reason I gave 3 stars was because of the freezing and pausing whilst streaming. Also the fact that even though I have downloaded something it suddenly freezes half way through and doesn't let me continue from there.
"Can not see default Audio Language on content option when scrolling/browsing Straight away. Hard to find it without playing first. Too many things being churned out to throw all at you and hoping few will stick. Recommendations is okayish. I like great documentaries but they mostly USA focused. Only Like and dislike button, there is no way to type feedback/reviews."
I've had netflix for more then a year and theres one thing in particular I'm very unhappy with. A box pops up about every 20 minutes asking me if I'm still watching. Its especially annoying when I turn an educational cartoon on for my just-now-turned-three year old grandson + try to catch a short nap. Impossible. I need the sound of my tv playing to sleep and I'm woke up several times a night because netflix wants to know if I'm still watching. As soon as I can get a smart tv I'm afraid netflix
"It's very good app But I wish they could Lower the brightness,the lowest brightness is still super bright at night"
"There's never an issue with the app having bugs or glitches (basically because I don't watch Netflix oftenly) but the reason I give it 3 stars is because the fact that movies and shows are just randomly being removed. And not enough shows or movies available to watch, nothing interesting, nothing fitting my taste. We need more ""Girl Power"" shows/series. Too much of the same in each category and not enough of these new shows popping up. It's the reason why I'm the one person who ignores watching."
"Love Netflix but hate the app. When trying to watch a video the screen is black but there is audio. When the video does play it plays for a few seconds then screen frezzes but the audio once again is still playing, I get kicked out and keep getting messages of service errors."
"The app is mostly great,however I have a problem. I watch a certain series composed of 8 seasons. The last season has premiered on December 14th 2018 I believe, so it is far from being new. The problem here is that basicaly everywhere that I have searched it seems to say that Netflix has all 8 seasons. However, on my account it only shows two seasons of whic I have already watched all of the episodes. I have tried looking everywhere around Netflix to see if I can somehow watch the remaining 6 seasons, but I can't seem to find them anywhere. And I don't want to be forced to spend even more money to watch the seasons streaming somewhere, even tho they currently don't stream anywhere. This show was the whole reason I bought Netflix for, and as of right now, I am starting to have certain doubts about whether I made the right choice spending my money on this app. Please fix this mistake here, because I can't watch this anywhere else other than Netflix and I have tried and waited for too long to watch this series. The same thing happened with another show, only consisting of three seasons, but only 2 were shown, again. I don'thave a problem with that, as I can watch it also on YouTube, but I wantted to point that out. And thus giing the fact that all of the other series with multiple seasons thatI have checked have all of the seasons, I don't thonk that this is fair towards the other people that watch this show. So please, fix this so I can watch this series in peace. ( You probably know already the series that I am reffering to, but in case you don't,I am talking about Voltron). Also, this may not be happening to other people, but I think it is fair enough to still help me in this situation as long as I am paying money on this."
"It would be awesome to have a feature that let's you only see shows or movies in a specific language. For example I watch a lot of anime but, only like to watch it in English. Well while looking for new shows or when my page is suggesting something new it would be cool to be able to tell it to only show me things I like or might like only in the language I want."
"The app itself is great. The content is awesome. There has been some problems with the downloads for months now. Downloaded content doesn't play and the techs don't seem to know the issue. When contacting support, they have no solution."
"I love watching Netflix and I've never had any problems till recently, I will be watching something and it starts to glitch it's kind of like it plays in slow motion so then I tap the screen it foxes it then a few minutes later it does it again. It's extremely aggravating."
"It's Netflix, so there's not a lot I can say about the service in general that would be novel. However, the widget has been bothering me lately. I don't want to see Dahmer and I've already given it the thumbs down in the app, but the widget keeps showing it to me. Netflix, please stop your widget showing people content they have expressed that they are not interested in."
I hate that I cant turn off the auto-preview. It's super annoying when trying to find something to watch. I feel like I skip over things faster and don't really take the time to consider something because I'm trying to skip off of it before the autoplay can begin. This should at the very least be something that I could turn off.
"While playing any movie, whenever I put the pause button, it pauses.. but after that when I touch the screen, the skip buttons won't just go away for like 10 seconds. Very irritating. What's the point og skipping 10 seconds, if you miss the next part due to the buttons, and go bavk 10 seconds again !!"
"Hmm I would suggest making all TV shows open to all, not limited to a region or country, it's been like 3- 4 instances now that, Netflix in my region is not showing up the TV series but it's there on Netflix for other regions. Also, I would suggest to offer low resolution, data saver quality streaming service for mobile devices, 1080p uses up data too fast. Just few things to ponder about as you guys are one of the main streaming giants out there...."
"Beautiful and clean UI, increasingly fabulous selection of shows and movies, nearly perfect. üëåMy only qualm is that it won't work while I'm using my VPN. Big thumbs down for that. üëéüëéSo I'll only watch when I'm not running other snooping apps."
"Love the content. My problem is with the fact that EVERY SINGLE TIME I launch the app I get an error ""Sorry we could not reach the Netflix service. Please try again later (-1023)"". I have to then exit the app, close it from the open apps drawer and then launch it again! Why????"
"Download support is nice, but no storage for SD cards. Video quality is fine, but no global settings for reducing bandwidth usage or downloaded video file size. It's a perfect recreation of the console or roku edition of the software. Makes me sad there's no extra control."
"Love Netflix. * Gets annoying when it constantly ask ""if ur still there"". There should be an option in the settings to turn this on or off. * Also make it easier to delete half watched shows. * also have an area to see what has been watched. Look forward to the improvements."
"Great app, but every once in a while I recieve error codes and the app cannot open. I have needed to uninstall and reinstall the app in order to restore function. Would be helpful if this would not happen at all. Happens once every few months I would say."
"I get having ads but I have to *X* out of the ad, and then press Resume on my movie. If you're going to run ads the movie should automatically continue. I shouldn't have to stop what I'm doing to press 3 different buttons to get to back to it, and especially when it happens every 10 min."
"A show will start playing and then the control buttons disappear or they wind up on another device. Annoying. Also, when are you going to add folders to organize My List? I'd like to be able to sort by genres rather than having one long clumsy list."
"Downloads don't work properly. They constantly pause when you're trying to download them. Then sometimes you fully finish downloading them, and when you later go and check, the download has been deleted or is halfway through downloading AGAIN. This is a huge issue for me, as it disables me from watching Netflix during an airplane ride."
"Problems with the casting controls, when you cast to a TV there is a pop up screen to control the program but often it freezes and you can't pause, skip or stop the program. Same problem with the controls on the notification panel. Otherwise a great app"
"Dear Netflix. Its extremely annoying that you disable the default brightness control when watching a program. I also find the brightness setting you introduced annoying, as I accidentally keep sliding it as I switch between apps. Personally I was perfectly happy with my phones default brightness control."
"Amazing app works wonderfully with some minor issues: I randomly get an error message (101.1.8) which says that the video file is unable to be played, I then have to erase and redownload all movies. The screen is a bit dark on my s9 plus irregardless of how much I increase the phone brightness, I can barely see when I'm in a dimly lit area. Smart downloads is awesome, however when watching TV shows after completing the last season it begins to download the first episode of the first season."
"It's surprising that Netflix on Galaxy Note 10 is so terrible. It freezes every time I try to pause and resume, over and over again. I have to move back to the homepage and resume the movie to fix that error. Netflix on Nokia 7 Plus is totally fine. Please fix it."
"App wastes time and signal trying to stream previews instead of downloading selections. If I leave the screen while waiting for the items I select to begin downloading, the app won't begin downloading or show that the item was even selected. Previews are there to help a person decide if they want to watch a show. If I've already selected the show, why is the app still trying to stream the previews ? And why does the app lose my selections if I leave the screen? Older versions worked better."
This app is amazing to watch favourite films on. However Netflix doesn't have every single film on the app but does release updates of films that will be coming soon on Netflix. Another downside is that you can only watch a film or TV show on 2 screens at a time. Unless you upgrade to 4 screens which entitles you to pay more money. An upside is that there is lots of profile pictures of most of your favourite Netflix original characters. I give Netflix 3 stars but this could change to 5. üåüüåüüåü
"Fantastic app as always, I don't have much to complain about other than occasional bugs or crashes. The exclusives and originals remain interesting! And i feel that the price could lower a bit ...though after all these years what I want to see most is a MUCH larger catalog! Especially in regards to Anime, Comedy, and Horror! More so in the Anime department, I'd love to see Netflix be able to competently compete with Crunchyroll, Funamation, Hidive, and the rest!"
Pretty good app only thing is you cannot changed your payment method via app. It HAS to be on a computer which is ridiculous. It'll say billing details and when your next bill is due but not an option to change payment method which is extremely annoying because not everyone has their laptop on them! Like cmon Netflix literally the most important feature.....
"I give it a 4 star because it's an amazing app, even though you have to pay for the subscription, the app works very smoothly the only problem I have with it is that there is not that many movies on there. In different countries for instance America there are way more movies. So if Netflix would please add some more movies on there because after all we are paying to watch movies.but the movies are old and I've watched most of them and the series's. Please would you add some more movies!!!!"
"love Netflix, have had it from the very beginning, but idk if it's a glitch or something but suddenly while watching a series instead of going to the next episode it shows a trailer for something else, it's kinda annoying having to go back to the menu to continue."
"As of right now my rating is 1. usally, it works fine and is fine, but for a while its not letting me play ANYTHING at all. I restarted my phone (that didnt work) I updated netflix (that didnt work) I tryed a different show/movie title (still wasnt working) so I don't know what netflix's problem is, but if you are paying for a servise and it doesnt work, then I dont know what your problem is. (if it desides to work I might consider changing my review)"
"Since last update, I can no longer go in accounts option and see any list of devices that are or were recently connected under device streaming activity. That option no longer exists on my mobile. That was a good feature to ensure no one else other than who I know accessed my credentials."
"The app is great however some of my peers and I would really appreciate it if you would put the show ""Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorperated"" back on Netflix! It was an amazing show and one of the biggest perks of having Netflix while it was still on there. Please take this into consideration and PUT IT BACK ON!üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠"
"I love this app but when I try to smart view it through my smart TV I cant, it plays sound and subtitles but not video. My husband has same phone same apps and same TV but he CAN watch it without problems. I tried using a different smart TV and i have the same problem. It has to be the app itself."
"I've had Netflix on all my phones for the last 5 years. After this last update, whatever I was currently watching does not get refreshed and I have to constantly skip forward, multiple episodes sometimes. It does not let me delete items from my list or currently watching queue."
"Despite being a good app, it's riddled with bugs that never get patched, if you choose to watch on WiFi only, your stream just closes, not stops, and you have to reopen the entire damn app, even if YOU ARE STILL CONNETCED TO WIFI but it changed network or cut out and recconnected, in android picture in picture the the UI pops up in a really glitchy manner, covering everything you can see, these are long time glitches and I doubt they'll ever be fixed, so if you don't care about consumers, 3/5"
"Good app but please unblock VPN'S, I just don't see why it's fair that you add multiple seasons of something and then take years between each one while releasing them in other countries as, take suits for example, seasons 1-7 on Netflix (Ireland) but not season 8 so I try to use a VPN just to get a message saying that I can't access it, I'm paying the same as people in Canada and can't get the same content as them, what gives? Why does it matter weather or not I use a VPN?"
"Dear netflix, I dont pay HD for stuck video. I understand that old videos always stuck but we accept it if we played old cd/video cassettes. In Netflix, we pay for smooth and enjoyable video not stuck one. It is your responsibility to make sure all the videos are smooth and cust will not being bothered by stucked videos. Please checked and only upload when the videos is smooth. The money I spent to pay comes in perfect amount and shapes. Not less and torn. Please. Thanks."
"The app often crash lately. Now, in the main page, it won't load. I can't watch anything. I've force stop the app, nothing happen. Seriously, if this continue to happen in the next month, Imma change platform. FR Edit: fixed. I had to restart my phone. But, seriously. I'm gonna change platform if this continue to happen."
"The mobile that I am using is honor play. Already got a 64 GB SD card installed but netfix app doesn't see it. I clearly checked and see that I have an external storage from my storage settings. I also checked the app settings an allow permission on storage. Unfortunately, still the same. It will only see the internal storage."
"I am having an issue, while watching if there is an interruption, the show stops and shows me a message, so I have to keep exiting the app, I do all that the message tells you to do. I then go back into my app and press the show I was watching and there will be that notice again. Almost like it's telling me I shouldn't watch the shows I'm trying to watch. This happens to me on a daily basis, numerous times a day. Anyone else having that problem?"
"Edit: Several updates later, still no fix. Borked up navbar and notification bar remains, and no cast button. Tablet version. Please fix, and this time when you do, DON'T BORK IT AGAIN! Edit 2: Fixed again. Great and all that but I'm getting a distinct feeling that it's not going to be long before it's broken again... 3 stars, for the it's-broken-it's-fixed merry go round."
Good overall but definitely room for improvement especially in relation to multitasking. The Netflix app totally cuts out any ability to multitask this app alongside another. üëéüëé This is includes normal multitasking on android devices and also does not work as a multi window app in Samsung DeX. This is extremely frustrating as it is something lots of people would like to be able to do is multitask and watch your favourite shows or movies at the same time on Netflix. Please update this.
"This is mainly for Netflix on TV. There should be a way for 2 people (in their separate homes) to watch the same show/movie at the exact same time, especially without having to be on the same account. There should be a way to add friends, and give them both the ability to start/stop/pause/FF/RW to same show or movie. I hope this is something you're currently working on. That would be an AMAZING new feature, guaranteed"
"Overall I enjoy watching shows on Netflix, but recently I have been experiencing an issue. Any time I try to watch a show it seems like it captures the previous image as an outline of the screen. I am not sure if this is an issue on my device specifically or if this is an isssue within Netflix's programing."
Everything isn't exactly good. We need you to update your highly watched series with all of its complete seasons‚Äîlike Grey's Anatomy! I'm so tired of wasting my Netflix subscription just to watch GA's seasons 16 and 17 on another free movie app because ya'll won't post its complete seasons on Netflix Philippines. If only there was Disney plus on this country I would have switched long ago. Ya'll like to keep holding some of your best TV shows back and for what?
"Netflix managed to become one of the most frequent streaming platform there is in the whole world. But that does not excuse the lack of dedication into managing their platform's performance. Subtitles for foreign shows, they don't display them correctly or at all. Show/movies with lack of information in description. Been years yet still, Disney plus is better."
"Enjoying most of the netflix experience but, after every other time i watch and episode of anything on netflix I have to restart my device because an of an error. Other than that rather irritating, time consuming monotonous chore which makes me want to throw my brand new kindle fire into the fire, I quite like this App and use it abroad."
I think this app is very useful and a great way to watch your favourite movies and tv shows. The only issue is that after I watch an episode or a movie I am unable to watch another one because it says error 505. So every time I want to watch something I can't cause of this. please fix it
"My video keeps hanging. Initially it used to be for a few seconds so I could go back 10 seconds and rewatch but for the past few days it just isn't working. The video freezes in like a few seconds. The audio goes on for a while and eventually stops then the app hangs. Even if I don't use it for a while. I'm even updated to the latest version so I don't know what to do. Somehow the same thing is happening with prime but before someone says there's something wrong with my phone, youtube works perf"
I keep having an issue where the screen goes dark. Like I've turned the brightness on the display way down and I cant change it. I have to uninstall the app and reinstall everytime and every time I do it tells me I need to update the app.. I've done this 6x now... I'm glad I'm almost done with the show I'm watching.. I'll be taking a break after.. very frustrating
"Cons: Terrible security, devs must fix this. My account recently was logged in another country(of which I have no family or friends using the account) and all my users names and avatars were changed, so I changed my password to secure the account and signed out of all devices. 12+ hours later all these accounts are still logged in, so I decided to cancel membership to possibly reset it in the future, problem here is that anyone that's logged in to my account can restart this membership without any verification, it's automatic...that is a big problem!"
"Netflix isa great place for watching almost anything but there is one bit of an issue, so basically Netflix has been removing another of stuff lately and its really annoying. I'll give u an example, so I log on to my i pad go onto Netflix search up haikyuu...then i see no haikyuu. I know some shows and animes might not get that many views n stuff or whatever the reason is, but if its to do with views please think of how many ppl love that show,but over all I really love le appüòå"
"No offense, but theres too much in the way of foriegn languages, not necessarily a bad thing... but there seems to be more than in my native tongue.... give an option and also when I've seen a movie I dont want it to always show up in trending just because you've changed the icon doesn't mean I want to watch it again.... put it under a seen folder?"
It does ok I have issues where I'm away from cell service and have to rely on satellite internet. It's completely useless by that point because they don't have a setting for low bandwidth streaming or downloading. The app just completely shuts down.
"Tried to get help from the live chat, my video kept stopping but audio continued. First guy was nice but we disconnected unfortunately, connected with someone else who was really bad. Lots of writing mistakes, didn't regar any of my messages. Just repeated the same question again and again. Tried to ask them if they're gonna send an email and the dude just said okay. Really confusing and made ne super upset I just wanted to watch Chicago med :(("
I really love it but recently it keeps crashing & chucking me out on phone & TV. Can be so irrating to the point where i give up trying too watch something to the end! Even thought about uninstalling & stopping my payment as it ruins the experience & makes it stressful so sometimes doesn't seem worth the money when i can just watch sky movies without issues! 2 yr old gets upset too when his favourite film chucks him out constantly! Its been the last month its got bad! Maybe after the update?!
"i really enjoyed it. actually, I've been binge watching a lot of movies and dramas whenever i'm bored. you can choose whatever you want to watch because they serve you with different kinds of genre. however, there were some movies were nowhere to be found but it's okay, i guess. nonetheless, it was an exceptional app, easy to use, convenient for the viewers."
"Netflix app is very useful to me casue I can watch wherever I want but recently, i just started to play a film then suddenly there was an error on the video. I tried to play different films but it's sayong the same error. The error does not appear when watching on my laptop, only on mobile. Please help."
"While it is by far the most user friendly in terms of its home screen and the site itself the content has gotten pretty bad of late. New movies on the Australian platform are primarily dubbed Spanish, Danish or Mandarin or are Netflix originals. There hasn't been anything in a long time that I'm really excited to watch."
"Netflix is a great app but.. I have saved many shows (some are animes) and movies but after a recent update, Some of the saved shows and movies has been deleted. Like the Anime ""Ghost Hunt"" that was the first thing I saved on my list but I can't find it anymore after a recent update. PLEASE FIX IT!!"
"Why did Netflix stopped working during call,now half of the people will not use it. So,disappointing."
"New update has a design flaw. The streaming button literraly hovers in front of the play/stop button, which means you can only the movie/show your watching or go into screen saving mode to play/stop movie/show your watching..very inconvenient. Other than that the app is greay"
"I do like the app because of their branding. But to be honest, I can't just give this app 5 star rating since it have the ""pros and cons"" which I'm not be able to find my favourite movie and show such as Real Housewives of Atlanta which they show only season 2 and season 4, plus there is a movie called ""Misbehaviour""(movie about pageant and I'm a pageant lover) and they removed it too. What I hope for Netflix is they need to invest a lot since they earned so much for more great movies to watch."
Used to love Netflix but not sure what is going on with them lately. Everytime I get into the app it freezes and kicks me out. It's happens daily. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I've had Netflix for many years and it usually always worked pretty good. But now it barely works at all on my TV ü•∫
"I didn't have any problems with the app since the last one year for which I have been using it. I paid for my monthly subscription this month, but since then, I am receiving error messages when I try to open the app. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, but nothing seems to work. I would love it if someone from the development team could please help me!"
"Can Netflix please add a way to mark a tv show as watched? Often I watch shows with people on other accounts or on other streaming platforms and currently, unless you skip to the end of every episode, the show/movie will not be marked as watched and will continue to be recommended. Other than that this app is very good and I haven't had any issues."
"The app is good. But the problem is, the library of movies and series are lacking. It's like u need to wait for too long in order for the other series to be added. It takes months or so more. If u could update the movies or series more faster and add more to your library i think it would be great."
"App became so complicated , can't find new things to watch, there is no recently added tab. As well as there are so many suggestions based on what I watched I don't need it, you might give me history in which we can see old data . And game tab in between nice movies and shows are so annoying . It all has become so complicated Netflix was simple and better with which we could chill üòí"
"Watching on phone cool, casting to tv from phone or tablet sucks. When casting we loose the controls for fast forward 30 sec. The control panel for the show/movie disappears and only comes back up after popping in to different screens. Such a pain!!! Would like it if they had a lists of shows/movies coming and going by month."
"Netflix app on my android device keeps giving me a prompt that the account is no longer in service yet it is, paid for monthly like regular subscribers, I uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times. And issue didn't resolve it seems to only be a problem on my android device. Like it works on other android devices just fine."
"So far so good, but it'd be great if you add 2x playback speed for us that have limited time It wouldn't reduce our retention in engaging the app though, you still can count by the completed movies we've watched. Lastly why the playback speed feature is not available in TV??!"
"Was able to add card and make a successful payment only through browser not through App, only with customer care support. I'm a first time Netflix App user and it's disappointing that I couldn't start my membership through Netflix App. Hope this is a crucial feature for this App."
"Gotta be careful because the app likes to randomly start the next episode even if you haven't finished the last one when you load it up. I've been so confused and given up on a few shows from frustration, but that it matters cause it's Netflix and they'll cancel it if I watch it anyway so..."
"I used like this app very much and would have given it a 5-star rating. However after the recent update, I no longer have the option of watching certain Japanese programs (e.g., Japanese Style Originator) with Japanese subtitle. Now I only have the options of English or Chinese subtitle. Please give us back the Japanese subtitle!"
"The app is good but it always signs me out and them tells me I have the wrong password when I try to sign back in (around 50% of the time it does this). Also, everytime I start to watch something, the screen glitches. It's like a static grey or green for 10 seconds before it clears up."
Love Netflix but I think you have a bug you need to fix. It has started showing shows from the beginning episodes and not where I left off or I can't even find it in my continue watching and I have to click on the episode I was watching and then it starts from where I left it last. Never used to be like that before.
"On screen brightness, but not volume. Why? No aspect ratio control. Why? SD only. Why? Basic video player options are missing on a paid service. Why they've dictated resolution limitations by phone model is unclear and out of touch with the user base (much like pc playback). Forced 18:9 cropped video is daft. Could be better."
"Netflix need to update their science fiction, action movies and Indian movies to the latest ones. I am tired of watching same thing most of the time"
Everything is good but i should have the option to manually adjust the Streaming Quality regardless of my internet speed if im troubled by the buffering then I WILL change the quality to automatic and only i will choose if i want to see something in 480p or 720p im not paying for you automatic quality adjustments even after paying that money for higher quality. please fix this issue immediately.
"Great when it works... For the third time I have to uninstall and reinstall the app. I get message that a title is not available to play instantly and suddenly nothing will play on my phone, though the same titles stream just fine on the Roku. A reinstall fixes the problem."
i love the app and all its content. i do wish it had a few more of the popular movies. Also i saw on other reviews and i agree that it keeps poping up with error messages and the quality of the of everything changes part way through watching it. netflix should also show what language things are in.
"I like it. But a lot of times I am annoyed why there are movies available in stone countries, and in another you can't find them. Also , suddenly the streeming is shutting down by its own when I watch on my tablet. And the least uncomfortable thing is when you can't find English subtitles for some movie and it is on a language that you don't understand.... So better fix this similar uncomfortable actions, we do wanna be satisfied. üòèüòè"
"The app itself isn't bad, but it uses an excessive amount of CPU on both a Pixelbook and Samsung Chromebook Plus (they get extremely hot). As such, I get about half the battery life I do streaming with Plex or Prime Video. Hopefully this is something that will be addressed in a future update"
"I loved Netflix for so long, we had other streaming services but Netflix was always my favorite. Nowadays.. it's declining, the price is increasing & the shows are decreasing. I get out with the old, In with the new. Though what is the point of keeping it, when all our favorite shows disappear."
"Good layout, can be convenient, but app is also buggy. Casting icon not always present, no longer seeing next episode button. Partially disconnects, so continues to cast, but cannot control from phone sometimes without reconnecting. Consumes a lot of battery while casting."
"For the last 4 months my app keeps logging me out about every half hour. If that hasn't been annoying enough, tonight it decided to log me out and not accept the only email and password I've had since i made the account. It keeps saying im putting in the wrong info when im definitely not. I dont pay for this subscription to not be able to use it."
"I've always loved Netflix, but I'm really disappointed how often I'm unable to play any of the downloaded videos I have. Even after updating the app I am unable to play anything I have downloaded for a full day. Of course to solve the problem it is suggested that I uninstall the app, therefore deleting my downloads, which is the opposite of helpful. Please fix this app before I choose to stop paying for it. It's far too expensive for this type of malfunction day after day."
"Netflix is a great app with a huge library and the developers actually listen. I asked to have Italian language and subtitles put into the movies and they did! What I don't love is that new ""fast laughs"" section. They're not even funny. Nor are they drawn from things I've actually seen, with the exception of one show and that's The Good Place. And that still wasn't funny. Also some of the humour is really gross, but I guess that's what I get for being an adult and having the adult content on."
"its nice and has a lot of good shows but my app keeps crashing even though i keep downloading and uninstall it over and over again, it just keeps crashing. anyways overall its a really good app and is one of the reasons i still can watch my favorite shows like TVD, Stranger Things, and Riverdale."
"I do not know if the issue is with Realme UI or netflix app is glitching but the video is glitching, Its having a matrix-glitch (like used to happen in Old TVs)like display on the screen whenever I try to play something while On apps like youtube/chrome/prime videos are playing normally with good quality. My phone is new and its scary i dont understand whats wrong."
"Great app, works fine, etc., but sucks my battery down even when I'm not using it, after I've closed all apps specifically to avoid nightly power drains when the device is not in use. The only way, it seems, to keep this app from draining the battery when not in use, is to uninstall, then reinstall when needed."
"Recent update seems to have broken something - pressing the info button crashes the app. If watching downloaded episodes, it stops playing at the end or just replays the same episode over and over, even if you are using wifi. The controls for getting to other episodes disappear so you're just stuck on an episode. The brightness adjuster also seems to have broken"
"I've been trying to watch netflix on my acer chromebook and before it worked perfectly fine. But now it goes through the process of loading netflix and it gets to the selection, but when you click on anything the screen turns green and it plays the audio but shows nothing. And it only does it when I watch The Originals. ???"
Its not working fine. For example if the movie is being played and if i receive any call or if any notifications come than the movie stops and post it doesn't play on its own even while pressing play on touch screen. It will only play if i press key of 10seconds rewind. This is purely a technical glitch
Everything works great except how freaking dark the screen is... the app takes control of your screen brightness so I can't even turn it up any brighter than the app let's me. It's extremely frustrating üòë üòí. Even daylight scenes are hard to see unless you're in the dark. I use my app on my desk while I'm working. I can never see anything. And if your watching a dark or mody show/movie you can't see anything at all. Please fix this its extremely frustrating. This is the most app expensive too
"Downloading episodes and movies is very easy. However, the fact that it can't play in the background when you hit the home button (like YouTube) is unacceptable. In 2019 they should be embarrassed to call themselves a video service."
"On Android for the last two months I've been having an issue where if I lock the screen while using Netflix, if I try unlock and reload the same show/movie, I get an error message and the show won't play until I reset the phone. Closing the app and reopening doesn't work, have to hard reset the phone."
"Whenever I come out in between and play again, it starts playing from the beginning and not at the place I left it. Worked well earlier but not now. Also when I go 10s back / forward in a video the sound subtitles and video are not in sync."
"These updates and changes are getting more and more ridiculous! Why would you take off the info button for recommendation that's the first thing you see when you open the app? All that's left is add to list and play. How would I know if I want to add to list or play without the info?? Ughhhh, can I go back to the previous version?!"
"I just discovered I don't have the choice of Japanese (original) audio for animes on my phone (it works just fine on the computer). Apparently I am not the only one with this problem, though. I sure hope Netflix will fix this, because it is really annoying!"
"I don't understand for the life of me why I will be seeing a movie or series and the picture will just stop moving or go completely blank! Nothing I have tried has fixed this. I have restarted, logged out and in again. Nothing works! I needed to see an episode of my favorite series to unwind after a hard day but only ended up being pissed off and frustrated. Why am I paying to view pictures I like if I can't actually watch them??? Fix this! I can't keep paying for something that barely works."
"The Chromecast link is still missing for my Netflix app. Followed all of the troubleshooting information online and nothing works to get it back. Chromecast icon appears in most every other app, I can cast Plex for my desktop, and then take it over from my phone, but the Netflix app does not cast."
Love Netflix except for when your watching a movie and it either goes to a night scene or even just a dark scene and you can barely see the movie at all. And yes I have turned the brightness on my phone all the way up and the brightness control for the app itself and sometimes it is still to dark.
"1st is its expensive. Look at hotstar. For ‚Çπ1499 a year, they're giving movies and series with 4k uhd dolby vision. Whereas you're giving dloby vision, but not giving it in 4k. And if its 4k, then you're not giving dolby vision. And an important thing I noticed is that I started watching a series, descendants of the sun and many scenes of the series have been cut from Netflix when I was watching from other sources. Now I only noticed about this series, but If there are more then pls don't do it"
"Video quality wise this platform is great, but what bothers me is the fact that some series or movies are not available in every country. I probably pay just as much as people from another countries, but for example popular series like American horror story or Grey's anatomy are not available for me. I pay a monthly subscription of 12 Euros, but in the end I still have to use fishy sites full of ads and viruses to watch some shows that should have been on Netflix."
"Please make an option to disable netflix's brightness adjustment. Netflix's slider cant go as dark as the native android brightness slider. Because of that netflix is always too bright for me in the evening, even at the lowest setting. Also, I always have my phone set at the correct brightness for the ambient light situation, so it's very annoying if I open netflix in the evening and it changes the brightness to a value from when I was watching during a sunny afternoon"
"For the past few weeks picture quality for streaming has gotten really worse. Bit rate for stream is really low, doesn't matter on mobile or on tv, same issue. I understand that due to the traffic you'll have to downgrade to cater to all but streaming 4k & 1080p videos at less than 1Mbps is really unacceptable. The picture quality is really bad due to low bit rate. FYI I'm on gigabit connection and streaming on YouTube and Tidal X doesn't suffer the same issue as Netflix. Please kindly fix this."
It crashes all the time. Can't even watch whole episode without freezing. Even after closing and reopening the app. Can only watch everything after downloading it. Please fix this issue instanly or I might rather change into other free movie/tv series apps and won't waste money. I'll give you 5 stars again after fixing the problem.
"On random moments of the show I'm watching, everything freezes or the screen goes black. I've restarted the app and uninstalled it and it keeps happening. I even made sure to clean my phone in case it was due to my storage and everything works perfectly fine but Netflix."
"Media controls don't appear on lockscreen on my Samsung s21 ultra after the android update, even with it enabled in settings. The app works alright most of the time, except while casting sometimes the skip intro button, rewind and fast forward buttons don't appear. And ofcourse there's the occasional frequent crashing."
The app is getting really annoying. I can't browse genres through search and I can't exclusively look at TV without movies and vice versa. They've put in the equivalent of Instagram clips from their shows for some strange reason. Also they've started pushing games. Why? No one goes on Netflix to see a 15 sec clip or play SpongeBob games.
The app has been slow and lags a lot... tried to download an episode that had a file size of 246 MB and even though my 5g speeds were 156 download and 12 upload after 45 minutes it was only 56% complete... download kept pausing if I didn't have the app actively open and waiting. Before anyone says something I checked all my settings... there's no reason for such slow downloads. Have a roku tv at home as well and every other app works fine but turn netflix on and it's so slow and not responsive.
"Great app, but I am very upset that I have to log in so frequently to maintain session alive. That is not good if I'm stuck with no signal on the subway. Just for that I am taking 2 stars. I can't emphasize how many times it's asked me to log back in after some minutes of inactivity when I'm far away from subway stations and WiFi signal"
"It's good I'll give it that but the reason it's getting a 3 star is because I may be immersed in a show just for a notification to pop up turning the screen blank. now ik you might say ""we'll turn off your notifications"" but I don't want to have to go into my settings to turn notifications on and off every time."
"The latest update has ruined the functionality of the app, especially when casting. Instead of staying active in the Notifications Bar, it dissappears (despite the movie still playing) so that you have to go through the process of opening the app again and finding what's playing just to stop or pause."
It's happening again again and again. The video is not working at all. The audio is working fine but with a black background. I had to install and uninstall to fix it. It's like 5th time I'm doing so. Could you please revert back the changes which you made in the recent release? The updates are crashing everything.
"The Netflix app on Chromecast is quite slow. It takes quite some time to stream. Asides this, you are forced to use 5.1 sound channel and if you have to switch to stereo, it reloads again. I would have preferred an option to choose sound option before streaming and the app remembering my settings"
2 thighs make it 3 starts instead of 5 for me: 1-it works badly with chromecast 2-when I'm deciding what to watch the list of movies gets reset to show the first movies randomly or when I tap to look at the details of a movie. This is very frustrating. I'm a mobile developer. I know it's super easy to make the scroll position stay when looking at a list. The constant reset to the top is frustrating :(
"Its meh. Some of the shows are good, but most aren't. The price isn't worth the quality; however Netflix>Hulu. Almost all other streaming platforms>Netflix. Netflix should cancel most of their current originals and bring back the animators most of the animated originals are somewhat enjoyable and I think if they focused on animations they may get good. Big fan of netflix grew up with it but its trash now so I wouldnt suggest renewel currently."
The only thing i hate about netflix the most is if u have a list of downloaded things in ur phone & u want to access d info of those video from d downloads tab. u can't do that. u have to return to d home page & then check it if it recommends showing up in there 2nd search engine is worse sometimes 3rd Can't u guys put up d volume or seek bar with just tap & slide as it is for brightness(sync up with phone default brightness) 4th sometimes the download nevr pauses out of a few when downloading.
Freeze frames on skip and playback after last update. If you try to skip 10 seconds back or forth the frame freezes but the audio continues in background. This is the same on an android tablet also. New issues since last update. Fine when viewing online or when you don't try to skip
"Not bad but the app needs technical improvement. Ok with the interface etc that's a personal opinion, but in all anime shows when the background is white you can't distinguish the difference of the colour with the subtitles so you can't read then. If there is any subtitles option for colour change etc I can't seem to find it"
"I love Netflix, but there's been an issue. I can't stay signed in to my account. I watch something, it stops playing, and signs me out. When I try to sign back in, it either takes the longest time or it says I have entered an invalid email/password (and I know I didn't). Please check this out."
"I'm using Netflix on Android and whenever I fast forward by 10 seconds, my video gets paused and the sound resumes. Eventually when both video and sound resume, they are out of sync. I have tried to find a fix to this issue but I couldn't find any help."
"I have a problem only recently. I watch netflix on vizio smarttv, USUALLY, but for the past week or 2 netflix app wont work on vizio smarttv. Ive watched it every day by clicking on it straight from my tv menu. No problem Until now. i click, get black blank screen, tv is still on, never loads netflix. Ive updated tv, & all other apps work same as netflix used to.wifi is still working so idk. Plz help"
"I noticed a bug. Like it always crash and said something like ""Sorry we cannot reach Netflix server"". I don't have any problem with my connection. Also, i would like to suggest to include subtitle when users use picture-in-picture feature. Kinda annoying to use the feature without subtitle showing."
"I have few problems about netflix, first,everytime I stop watching the drama/movie, of course we have to pause it, but when I open to watch it again, it starts from the beginning of the episode,there should be a continuation not repeat from the beginning. Second all the movies and dramas that been watched but not finished must appear on the home page, not that you have to search the drama again."
"Can you please categorize ""My List"" into ""Watched"" and ""Yet to watch"".And then sub categorize the both category into ""Series"" and "" Movies"".I can't keep track of what I have watched and what I haven't and when I refer to ""My List"" after watching a movie or series,I have to open and read the review or storyline of a series or movie to remember if I had already watched it and this wastes so much of my time.I am sure many people can relate to this issue.I will rate 5 when you introduce this feature"
"Netflix was working just fine until recently. These days I'd just be watching something and Netflix would remove me from the movie screen. It wpuld take me away from what i am currently watching, back to the home screen. Just like that. I think this needs to be fixed"
Mediocre at best. Any classic movies? How about mixing in more variety of genres? It's like one random person just picked what they happened to like and now that's the only type of stuff the get. It took me about a month to see EVERYTHING I had any interest in on this app. They need more variety.
"Please continue fairy tail, and add more animes."
"3 stars because I watch a lot of dramas and movies in foreign languages, and I have a problem with the subtitles. I'm a native English speaker, so when the actors are speaking Korean, Mandarin, etc. the translations are ok, but the subs go away if they start speaking English. I don't just use subs because I can't understand, I also use them because I have trouble hearing! Please have the subs up for the ENTIRE episode, even if they start speaking the language the subs are written in!"
"The ""+ My List"" has been broken for a while now, it used to work just fine until the few latest updates. I can't remove the added items from My List, but need to remove it from the Android TV app. The button always shows ""+ My List"" even for items already in My List, and when I pressed the button, it just disappeared. Fix it for this otherwise great app."
"This has been a great app but recently its not skipping forward properly when press the ""10 seconds forward"" button and this has not improved after the latest update. Apart from that its definitely better than the Samsung TV app which has a new layout which is cumbersome and difficult to navigate"
Netflix is always having trouble accessing titles. This mainly occurs when viewing netflix using the TV app. It is frustrating paying for a service that is unable to run smoothly regardless of the time of day. Netflix please improve this service or else I will have to dispense with it.
"Brightness setting overrides system brightness. That was a poor decision, please fix this by removing the feature or having the option to not use it in the settings. The app doesn't track progress through a show very well, especially across devices, and has trouble logging in at times. Seems to work reasonably well otherwise."
"Good app but uses a lot of memory. Also if there were more ways to organize, like playlists, and ways to search it would be nice. Also warn us before u remove content please. They do back a lineral agenda, but its ok I guess. I know they have watch later and continue but we should have more. Also maybe if u could rate movies by dtars instead of rhumb up or down? Idk, just a thought. Good value for the price though, and original content to boot."
I've enjoyed to watch Netflix for my whole life as I can remember. But NOW when I click a show it gives me thr trailer instead of episodes. I'm don't with flash trying to go to my list and watch supergirl but it gives the trailer/ preview INSTEAD and only that. But when I go on my phone I can do just that. Please fix this bug Netflix because I like watching videos on my tablet NOT MY TINY SCREEN PHONE!!!!!!!
Please remove the minimum brightness level which is set default by the app. It's to bright and irritating
"Great app but would like more options, like to turn off picture-in-picture if I want, maybe an option to select the resolution instead of just adjusting it automatically, and the option to remove the black bar that's next to the notch, I have a teardrop notch so the little camera cut out doesnt bother me much, I'd like to use the space next to the camera as more space for watch I'm watching, even if my eyes never look at something that's that far to the side"
"I've been trying to sign up on Netflix with Google Pay but it doesn't seem to work.. I am using an android trying to figure out how to pay with a Google Play Gift Card and I can not find a way to do so. If it is not possible, I then think this is a disadvantage of this app and I would really love it if they added an option to pay with Google on both ios and android."
Interface is not good Findings movies a great task No top movies recommendation No suggestions Work on it netflix team that why user don't want to pay to you
It is a very useful app. But from some days i cant download videos from this platform from my WiFi. I just click on the download button and then the download has started but it doesnt process above from 0 percent . I think it maybe bcz of the wifi but other apps are running pretty well . Plz solve this bug or issue asap
"I hate when you type in a topic that interests you i. e. True crime documentaries ) it's doesn't give you/ show you all available titles in your particular choosen subject. Regularly buffers or tells me titles aren't currently available as there having trouble playing them. Finding I'm using Amazon Prime more & more frequently these day's, great at showing other programmes that might interest you, &/ or suggest other shows based on what you watch etc. Long overdue a good revamp in my opinion"
"I like Netflix, but the only issue is the pricing. Netflix is 4x more expensive than in other countries. The pricing should be as follows : Mobile = ‚Çπ49, Basic = ‚Çπ119, Standard = ‚Çπ159, Premium = ‚Çπ199, all per month. If these are fulfilled, Netflix will become the ultimate streaming app in India too! If you bring these pricings, then I too will subscribe after my free 1-month trial and give this rating a 5 Star!"
"Everytime i log in to netflix website and see recently device streaming activity always find out the unknown device and IP address log on to my account. And recently viewed movie showed random movie i never watched listed in the watched list. Pls fix this. If you guys cannot upgrade the security, atleast require a different password for each profile."
I don't know why but the playback won't work and it doesn't show you where you left off anymore. I clicked the series I watched but it plays back to the first minute. I want to skip it but it always stays at 0:00. I tried restarting the app but it's still the same. I tried to reinstall the app but now i can't even sign in to my account. Please fix this...
"There is an issue with Chromecast where it defaults to 5.1 audio every episode, but my TV doesn't support 5.1 and this disabled the volume control. Every single episode I have to change it to stereo just to adjust the volume. This is very very very very very annoying"
"Every now and again, a top of the line movie or show is released. Keeps me hooked until all the seasons are watched or the movies are all watched. What I DONT understand is why are so many foreign movies and shows being put on here. I dont want or need to see shows from India or watch a movie that is dubbed to English in America. It never matches me to what I'm interested in but always recommends some foreign thing that I wont waste a minute watching."
It only lets you have one viewer at a time super annoying for big families other than that love it.
No problem with the contents. All is well except the constant crashing of the app. I have to remove the app and reinstall to make it work again on my account. Please fix this since I've been a subscriber for more than a year now and this problem is coming at least once a week in different devices.
"I used to love Netflix, but lately there has been way to many movies that are not good. I just constantly scroll until I just give up. Nothing really eye catching to me. But whenever good movies do come on the streaming, I will watch. But, for right now, I have been watching other streaming services. But, I do love the baking shows."
"I love netflix before but I noticed that 4k movies/series doesn't look that good. I recently had apple TV+ on my samsung 4k hdr tv and when I watched movies from there, I can see the difference with Netflix. Although, Apple TV used 80Mbps of my bandwidth, but that's the whole reason I have a 100Mbps connection. Hopefully, netflix will increase the bit rate."
"help, please? i love the variety on this app, that part's great, but my app keeps 'crashing'(?) like, the screen turns black / and or freezes and the audio keeps rolling. what am i supposed to do to stop this from happening? there's no update option and everytime i uninstall and reinstall the app nothing changes."
"The app itself is ok. I can stream content with ease and the UI is fine to use. I like the download feature for on the go. Unfornately, the content for the UK is below par and nothing like what is available in the US. Netflix is certainly not value for money in the UK."
"Content is good, however, everytime I pause a video and it sits there for a while, I would have to relaunch the app to play the video again. Otherwise, it's only the audio that will work, but the video is stuck to black screen."
"The app worked fine but it updated and now says ""Device error"" occurred when I try to watch anything downloaded, I even had to reboot the app and it still wouldn't play. It deleted my downloads and just doesn't work at all now. Very disappointed as I enjoy watching Netflix"
The UI/UX whichever it's called is imo the best on the Android app. My problems are the lack of being able to manage your account fully and completely in the app without using an external browser. Technology has gotten far enough along and this app is old enough that certain expectations are achievable.
"My account was recently logged into from another country, and the person changed the settings, language as well as the plan. Customer service helped me get it back to my mobile plan, but now I will be charged twice within 8-9 days for my monthly subscription, because billing cycle changes upon upgrading the subscription. Even though this change was due to hacking, and there is proof of that in the account information, I am forced to pay twice. You should address this issue."
"The app crashed a lot of time already. I already uninstalled and install it again. But when I open it, it crashes after a few seconds. It makes me frustrated because I have downloads already and now I have to download them again. Please help me fix this. I really love this app"
"The most recent update put the ""cast"" button right in front of the ""pause"" button... I tried swiping up and am then able to pause, but then the stop button is blocked. It was better when the ""cast"" button was all the way at the top... I use a Samsung Galaxy S9."
"I am writing this in hopes Netflix personal are reading theses. I'm an android user, the app forces us to use the screen lighting all by the Netflix app. Some times the app doesn't even respond to the touch on this specific feature (the screen light scroll line). It's also the most inconvenient tool ever implemented in the Netflix app. Please remove the scene light control. Thank you from a multiple time daily user."
I would give it five starts but I do not think that there are alot of options in what to watch to be honest I would much rather prefer TV but the only difference is with Netflix they have Netflix originals that are most of the time really great. I also sometimes struggle to play downloads when there is or is not internet
I love Netflix so much I think I'm addicted but I'm rating 3star because after the recent upgrade I noticed that my movies keeps skipping by few seconds and sometimes the video hangs while the audio keeps playing. It's making streaming frustrating for me so please if the developers could fix the bug that would be great.
"I just have a problem with the service in general. I can watch the titles, but I cannot see any options for subtitles. I can't watch Street Food anymore because since I don't have any subtitle options I am not able to understand the majority of what people is saying. Plus, if I need to add a title to my list, it won't stay there and it will seem as if I never marked it, so I have to do it from a computer."
"The overlays on the screen, i.e., the play/pause, jumping 10 secs forward/backward, the overlays at the bottom don't go away like it used to before when we just had tap on the screen. Now, I have to wait for it to go away automatically after a while. This is making the whole streaming experience very infuriating. Please fix it."
"Been getting message that says, SORRY WE COULD NOT REACH NETFLIX SERVER AT THIS TIME, PLEASE TRY AGAIN LATER (-1023) which started a couple of updates ago. Well I talked to Netflix representative and they said they are aware of the problems and the only thing they could suggest was to install on a different device. They said they have had numerous reports of glitches with the application on android devices. Hopefully they will find a fix soon."
It's okay but whenever I go to download a movie Netflix is saying that I don't have enough data but I do..
Had major issues with this app. Found out it could have been the play store. Netflix was requiring a clear data/cache every start to work. So I tried to reinstall from play store and got to 77% each time and it stalled. Only fix was to clear data/cache for play store then it worked. So not sure who to blame with this one... hence 3*
"Was using the app for chromebook for over an year now. From last week, I am not able to use Netflix properly. It gets crashing every time. I deleted and reinstalled several times but in vain. Please tell me what to do as I dont know how to contact you other than this platform. I am giving you 3 stars for the commendable service you have given me for over the last year."
"I just updated the app and now it's not functioning well. It doesn't auto rotate and the rotate button doesn't work. Also, the forward and back button is not working either. Lastly, the icons seem to disappear once drama/movie starts to play."
I love Netflix but watching on my phone sorta sucks. I can barely see the screen and cannot turn up the brightness because Netflix has control of that. The app turns my brightness WAY down when it starts. Very frustrating! I'm off to watch RuPaul on a better screen. üò¢
"I'll give it 5 stars if y'all fix the bug I keep installing and uninstalling Netflix on my phone because it keeps acting up saying I have no internet access or try again later thing when my device ans internet connection is VERY good, please also fix the ""continue watching for- ."" Because it doesn't continue when I close the app then it makes me continue the episode I've already finished!"
"I don't know why Netflix wouldn't allow it's users to watch the libraries from other countries noting that the subscription is almost the same for everyone,I highly suggest adding another subscription with an international access to other countries or at least 3 or 4 of your choice which will add a lot of new users and also keep the customers very satisfied always ,Please look into this matter as many customers aren't renewing their subscription due to poor library especially in Middle East."
"It plays great on my phone and Roku but it won't work on my computer. I lost my remote so I figured I would mirror it from my computer and everything works great until I hit play and then it's just a black screen with the volume. It's extremely frustrating. I tried downloading something to see if that would work and it was the samething, volume worked but it was a black screen :-("
"I am a lover of Netflix and use it on almost all ""consoles""/electronics. But recently it stopped opening up on my phone(Samsung galaxy A5) it will open and say Netflix but no loadscreen, whos watching or anything. I've tried clearing cache, data, and uninstalling and reinstalling the app even uninstalled completely for a week and reset my phone a couple of times. I use to always cast from my phone to all of our smart devices but now I'm SOL"
"I rate it three stars because, some of the shows I watched like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the seasons are not complete, episodes not complete, I want to watch the next seasons- 3,4 & 5 because it is not over and there are only two seasons.... Im disappointed... But the other shows, its great.... And there are some movies I search and want to watch is not available in Netflix."
"App is great and all, but i seem to have a problem that sometimes the app just cant connect to the servers and cant reconnect no matter what network im on or how many times i reopen the app. that's the only reason i deducted 2 stars. Because it's a real inconvinience to have to install the app again at least once a week."
"It's a good app , good price but it could do with keeping some tv series or adding some from the past for a bit"
"Almost everything is fine... except sometimes its shows error in playing the downloaded videos on the very next day when I have downloaded them. And this is such a pain because when you had already downloaded a title then what's the issue, and when regarding this I contacted the customer service, they told me to re download the title as the reason behind the particular error isn't being founded yet."
"Wow, Netflix is expensive, you don't even have a lot episode of some shows, and THERE'S A DUB TO ATTACK ON TITAN??? But Netflix is overall a pretty good app, but it doesnt deserve my 5 star rating! I have been using it for a while... Also if u having problems on Chromebook just go to the website please!"
My favorite show so Far has to be the deep. It's a family that explores the deep sea and they have a pretty cool submarine. I was really disappointed when I realized there was missing episodes Not just that it's also missing seasons to the Deep. The deep has 4 seasons right now but if you go to the deep you can find it has only 2 seasons but there's a 3rd season that's is glitched with the 2nd Season.
"What's wrong with the latest update? I have been using this app on a Galaxy S10+ and have been having issues with resuming paused shows and also the forward option does not work, it just pauses the video on forwarding. Also, the issue is the same on both wifi and cellular data. Reinstalling hasn't fixed the issue. The iPhone app works seamlessly though."
"I really like netflix, other than the price hike, taking good movies & tv shows off plus not renewing shows for no reason. Im not liking how i cant take off shows that im done watching off my "" still watching list"" ive attempted doing this for month and the 2 shows will not disappear. We will still keep netflix until theres no further reason too."
"I love Netflix but it just seems unfair to having pay the same subscriptions as in other countries and not get the same content, too few movies in my country and if ever there are new ones it's always late when being uploaded. I just wish that we all get the same content as others."
I like the app love my watchlist. Price point is good as well. Why am I canceling and giving only three stars you ask security. Yes security my account was hacked and I actually had a harder time getting back into my own account than the thief. Who not only changed my profile (except payment info of course) but also set up three additional profiles for friends I'm guessing. But yeah not keeping this app.....
"I have been with netflix off & on now 4 quit some time. We enjoy our family movie nights now with NF than we did waisting all that money renting at the redbox. But in recent days im afraid we may be returning due 2 NF showing so many foren movies without the option of english vocal translation making it to where i have to miss the movie having 2 read what there saying. Also if i already have seen it it should be on my list of already watched, like the continue watching! Remove whatüëéoff my list"
"* Edit 21 Jan 19 - Fixed in the following update 3 days after it was broken * Latest update has broken it again. Videos never get past 98 or 99% on Chromecast. Have tried all the troubleshooting steps (reboot, uninstall, clear caches and data etc). Had time to watch 40 minutes of Sci-fi before the wife got home, instead wasted it all trying to get Netflix working again."
"I've loved Netflix since I opened an account back in 2018, but with more of my favorite shows not being able to play in my region even though being on a premium account. I've started checking what shows are available on other streaming websites, which is making me reconsider my subscription."
"PROBLEM. I love me some Netflix but is there any reason you removed the continue watching messaging from appearing on mobile devices,no fall asleep alot watching Netflix but now I wake up to any series I'm watching completely finish from half way through or so, not sure if it's my device or not but any help would be appreciated."
I kept searching for Gran Turismo but I couldn't find it and when I search the web it says that the movie is already available at Netflix
"I love movies, but I am growing so weary of the woke agenda in any of the newer offerings. My finger hovers over the cancel service button on a regular basis. A few characters here and there go unnoticed and just fine, but when a third or more of the characters are ""identity political "" I just have to turn it off. I watch to relax, not for social conditioning that is not needed in our house."
The service itself is alright but what hate about Netflix is how many shows can only be watched in certain regions and how some of the seasons are available in most regions but the rest of them can only be watched in a specific country like Japan or Brazil...extra I personally feel very cheated when i see that these shows can't be watched when the fee is the same here as everywhere else and i don't really wanna download a VPN just to counting watching a series or anime just to delete it afterüòë
I like this app but I rated it 3 star because the subtitle is always wrong on any movie or anime that speaks japan. Pls fix this
"Well the service is good but for a long time I was having download issues and now I don't even get a video, just a black screen and audio. Android 10, most recent security update, and an odd aspect ratio, but I still should be able to see so"
Where is the video speed controls? I could change video speed in the earlier version but not now. You take one step forward and then two step backwards. The update had one job - improving user experience and you guys couldn't even do that right.
Price went up and it makes it harder to afford you. Id prefer u going back to original price rather than watching all ur originals
"Not that this needs to be said but this is one of the better streaming services. Faster downloads than Amazon. I'd probably give 5 stars if this had something similar to Amazon's X-Ray. I said the same thing to Amazon about adding a lock screen and download speeds. I'm looking forward to seeing who does what first. Also, who is gonna go ""I love these ads! 5 star ads!"" WHAT!?!"
"Netflix removed a lot of their anime selection in favor for really well known shonen or ""beginner/casual"" anime. It really sucks. It seems like you can scroll through netflix for hours and find nothing to watch. The originals are boring (except for black mirror and stranger things, which admittedly was actually really really predictable the whole time). I wouldnt pay for another netflix subscription. I'd rather use hulu which has a bigger anime selection."
"App is not opening after upgrading Android 10. After upgrading Android 10 app was keep on asking me for sign up every time I start app. Even after putting correct password it was not letting me in. ( I could login from web browser) . So I uninstalled app and installed again. Since then I'm getting message , sorry could not reach Netflix services."
You used to be able to exit out of the app and still have a window playing on Android but after the most recent update there's just a notification to click to go back to the show/movie. It was my favorite feature over Hulu..oh well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"I liked the previous update where you were able to see what was about in miniature, it was actually incredible handy but now its back to the old way i find incredibly dated and an inconvenience. So please in next update i urge to change it back. However other than that mess, Netflix keep up the good work."
"Netflix app installed on Lenovo Tab M7, works fine. But something keeps disabling the app in Google Play Store. App still shows available and installed in store, but instead of Open it has a Disabled button. It also disappears from the app drawer when disabled. Tapping the button enables the app again and it appears again in the app drawer too. Works fine again after enabling, but dissappears again after a while What is causing this? First time I am experiencing this..."
I love its shows but after update i am facing so many error such as 1)video stuck (stop playing) without any loding circle and them i have to restart Netflix to run it.2)while runing a series some time it just throw me out from the video i don't know what to do with error but ruins my enjoyment and mood please fix this.And please don't tell me to email this same think to you can aslo rasie this by yourself. Most error are in matrix reloaded please check it (i am using netflix mobile pack)
"Ever since the new update every time I watch a show the subtitles comes on. Then after a few minutes the show stops so I have to start the show again. And of course the subtitles comes on and I have to turn them off again. Every show, each time I have to turn off the subtitles. Its extremely annoying. Please fix it."
"It's used to be good. Recently on android after u exit Netflix, the screen will be pitch black with no image. Don't know how many times I have to reinstall to make the screen come back. There are times where even reinstalling does not help. Pls fix as soon as possible"
"Just want to say that regarldes that i do enjoy this app, the only sad part about it is that why is it that certain movies cant be watch at some region. If netflix is one company why is it that some movies cant be watch at certain areas. I hope that managment can fix this issue because its sad. Ive talk to customer service and they mentioned about some agreement with movies from others country cant be watch at certain areas. I dont really get why but hope they can fix issues like this."
"Netflix is good but could be better. Netflix needs to make it an option to remove the LBGTQ ads / movies / shows from being shown. I don't agree nor support this type of lifestyle and to have it thrown in my face through ads and shows is not appreciated. Could be an easy toggle option to show / not show, to respect the views of all customers rather than a particular group."
"Would read more if there was a way to mark a season / episode as watched.. sometimes there are Rogue unwatched items in something I have watched!.. and they seem to linger around in my unwatched list forever!.. and the ""new episodes"" should be an overlay, that either disappears after a time OR after you watch them.. otherwise it states ""New episodes"" when you have seen them all!"
I like Netflix some of your original shows are great. I got very into a few of them but it takes entirely to long for new episodes to come out. And the other shows and movies just aren't good enough for me to want to pay for the service while waitng for new episodes to come out. Just my opinion. Also if a movie has sequels please have all the sequels and not just the first movie.
Overall a good streaming app. Recently facing an issue where the video pauses and comes with a pop-up stating device failure. I tried to uninstall and then reinstall it but the problem still persists. Please do fix this matter asap otherwise one of the best streaming app.
"It gets boring at times they don't keep recommending more movies and they have a lot. Also lately it has been failing to load sometimes but sometimes it does. It just acts some how sometimes. But its a great app, I've watched most of my best movies/series on this app so yeah just the bugs."
Everything is good about Netflix when it comes for watching something. But whenever am asked to update my payment am unable to do it. It not taking up my payment and it's repeatedly asking for my CVV number. I had to take a second account because of this payment issue and my current account is on hold.
"Netflix really sucks at trailers. It's mainly what I use the app for, since watching via Roku I get no trailers whatsoever. But the ones available in the app, when they are available, seem like hastily assembled afterthoughts farmed out to someone's twelve-year-old with some editing software."
"Netflix just has too much space and all the apps I have are Snapchat, YouTube, and Netflix. No games. Plus Netflix keeps on doing a weird thing where I'm watching the episode and then it just goes straight to the next episode, to any of the Netflix staff members, please fix this issue, overall though I love it how I don't have to watch ads, so I'm rating it a 3 because it's not bad neither good, I hope that this was helpful to people that want to get Netflix :')"
"My phone seems to have lost sync with chromecast. No pause button. At end of episode, no play next episode. No skip intro either. I have to shut down everything and then restart (phone and chromecast) jut to either watch next or even stop casting. It keeps casting but I cannot play next without shutting down first."
"There's a couple of bugs in this app. I tried adding some shows to my list and it isn't even working. Same applies when I try to remove from list. Sometimes when I press resume after pausing a download, it isn't even working."
"I'm from Germany and began to watch alice in borderland two days ago. I downloaded the 1st season on my phone and wanted to watch some episodes on my TV, but couldn't find the series when I searched for it. the downloads on my phone still work tho but I can't find it when I search for it on my phone aswell. when I go to more to download from my alice in borderland downloads, it just leads me to the trailers, but no episodes. was the series taken down or is there a bug? if so, please fix that!"
I like it but the screen limit when I went to watch with my family it said there is a time limit!!!
"There is no clear way to report an issues with the app specifically. The error mentioned in many comments has been happening for a long time now. The ""solution"" to restart the device is not adequate given its a paid for service. There are no release notes for changes on the 6th of Jan to indicate if it was supposed to resolve the problem or not."
"Fairly slow, I guess that depends on your connection but I think its just true nowadays. Other than that occasional buffering, I wish they'd provide a split screen view option, not just pop-up view. Im a multitasker, and i like being able to still see whats happening while I text, reblog, like, ect. Like YouTube!"
"excellent, however would love to see more of a selection when it comes to what is available, also the anime selection isn't very vast, would've been cool if you had bleach, eureka seven, exile, alfen lied and other series that animax used to have or even black butler, yuri on ice or high school of the dead.... also disappointing that you remove things like ""erased"", your movies could also be a bit more diverse or up to date. Series are cool, documentaries are OK and love your stand up comedy"
"I gave 3 out of 5 stars because I wish Netflix would have our accounts set up so that when you watched a movie it went into a ""already watched "" category after every movie. There are hundreds of movies and we don't always remember if we have seen them or not. 6 months goes by you forget. Would be a great addition for an upgrade !!"
"Crashes Hello! After downloading the app, it seems to work well when i watch tv series and movies but like as time passes like within the day of downloading, when I opem netflix, the app closes like it somehow crashes? Hope you can fix this :( I'm using a Vivo Y53. I'd have to uninstall and install the app again to watch :("
"Something's wrong with the app. Every time I try to play a show that I've downloaded, it gives me error (102.2.7) I restart my phone every time, but it's getting really annoying to have to restart my phone every time I want to watch a downloaded show."
"Movies are severely outdated, or they're trying to cram moviesvfrom over seas down your throat. Personally its their creativity and goodness (notice I didn't say great) in turning out entertaining series that keeps me coming back. Netflix isn't wasn't used to be, both good and bad, they have lost some of their swagger, and if they aren't careful Disneys, Paramount, and/or Amazon will surpass them, and might I add and doing it at half the price. Js"
"It's a good app... But there are problems. First the tv shows or animes often disappears I don't know why they need to remove stuff very often. I was watching an anime and I got cut off so please fix that.Next, when I open nexflix shows if I keep it on too long it auto starts. I hope you don't do auto start or please put it in the settings it's so annoying. Finally, the age ratings are so rigged like shows like boss baby or other children shows are violence?! Please don't be too hard.Thats end."
I love Netflix but what's the point of me getting into shows and watching full seasons just to find out there's not gonna be another season and no ending to the series.It's disappointing AF!!! One example is Country Comfort. It won a prime time Emmy and still got cut because it wasn't on the top 10 for more than 10 days which is Netflix's fault anyway because there should have been more episodes in the first season and it would have to longer to watch and been on the top 10 list longer.
"App Needs some. work smart download does not work!! Movies stutters during playback Amazon videos dont do that, so its not my phone or wi-fi connection. Cannot down load full season with one click have to dl one at a time...you can with amazon. Come on Netfilx get up to speed and fix bugs."
Why does nowadays didn't have variety of subtitles?
It's not too bad definitely some good things to watch BUT I hate that now for some reason the subtitles turn on randomly or if I come back to something also sometimes the brightness bar decides to not show up... Would also love more variety and up to date movies and TV.
"I enjoy Netflix but its frustrating when I download something on my iPad and watch it and then delete it and wanna download something on my phone but it wont let me cuz I ""have downloaded on to many devices"" and I have 0 downloads on every device. Closing the app on all devices doesn't help... Ps. Thanks for adding Studio Ghibli"
"Recently, whenever I try and watch anything, the video will freeze while the audio continues, and no matter what I do, nothing fixes it. I have tried closing and opening again, reinstalling, restarting my phone, nothing works, and as far as I can tell none of my other devices have this problem... how do I fix it?"
"Too many foreign shows with crappy voice over and too much low budget junk to be raising monthly fee and only because Amazon Prime got away with it, but with Prime there are many other benefits AND they have many more 4 and 5 star movies and you can actually see the ratings. The app is well designed though."
I find that due to how long shows take to actually show up on this i just watch them elsewhere. but for things that are on it it's good. I appreciate small things like the smart download feature and the ability to skip intros.
I reside in South Korea but I don't speak Korean and many shows don't have English subtitle options that are available in an American Netflix account. Please keep the English subtitles for all shows in Korea that have that option in America. There are a lot of foreigners in Korea that cannot enjoy a show on their Netflix account because the English subtitles are not available.
"I love Netflix but, I've be realizing that Netflix has been tripping. It'll freeze and when I first go on a movie or show, the screen will be black but the audio is playing. Please fix this and other problems, that other people have been experiencing."
"Its good enough , until I tried to cast my phone Netflix to my Smart TV, then to my projector and then my laptop , and in all , some movies will not show. I use smartview from a Samsung A31 to Hp laptop, yet all I get is a blank screen with the subtitles and al other function tabs showing but not f he video . Even while its showing fine on my phone but not on the screen it is cast to. All other things show ok until i play a movie, I get sound but no video ."
"Sucks at pausing downloads. It's a good app but whenever I'd pause a series from downloading so that I'd download the other first, it'd resume its download although I've paused it countless times. I'm rather in a bad mood for experiencing this :// Although I could had downloaded it either way but it keeps resuming although I've paused it, I've basically wasted so many data from this, it keeps resuming so this sucks."
Is anybody else getting more and more error notifications?? To the point I have to uninstall and reinstall app over and over again?? Gets old after a while especially when I'm paying for a service so to have to stop mid program and have to do all of that is somewhat annoying.. and most of all disappointing
We need new movie selection for kids! And when I exit the app and i'm using my phone for something like texting or checking Fb my Netflix starts playing in the back ground. Just the sounds not the video. Then I hvae to go and exit out of the whole Netflix thing so it can stop.
"I would rate it 5 stars but the issue ""Your tv isn't part of the Netflix household for this account"" is so annoying. It always need to verify the text, my mom just connect to his boss netflix so it will take long to verify. This occur many times and I'm getting tired of it."
I've had netflix for the last 10yrs. Been happy til 5 days ago. It won't load at all. And when calling customer service they just want me to reset all my devices. Well I did what they wanted for an hour straight and it still won't load. The problem is your Netflix not my devices. Please fix the issue!
"Shows or movies that you want to continue watching for the most part don't always show up on a different platform. Example I could be watching a show on my ps4, then later on I'll be on my laptop looking for the show and can't find it. The show or movie should be the most recent item on the continue watching subtitle on any platform. I would literally have to go back on my ps4 just to find the name of the show or movie"
The app is great netflix is perfect for killing time or chilling but i give you 3 because the trailers of the movies that you provide are just cut scenes from the movie and some times those scenes show who live who die how the movie will go and this is such a movie killer im not speaking only for the app im speaking genuinely for Netflix PLEASE STOP THE SPOILERS!!
"This app has various issues. Update: latest bug, it won't indicate a shows progression when in the swipe down window of the status bar. It counts some seconds, then reverts to 0 seconds and starts over. Also, the app uses to remember if I want to skip show intros. Now it keeps asking for every single episode of a whole season. Annoying"
"App is great but for some reason in the latest update video quality is not an option anymore. I start watching a show and the video quality get worse and worse as seconds pass by and it seems I can't decide in which resolution I will play a video. The only solution for me is to download what I want to watch and then it's all fine. To sum it up, right now it's really hard to to enjoy the app and I really hope that you guys notice the problem and fix it."
"Mix Reviews. Good thing about Netflix is that it has good content, better than other service providers. Cons: They don't offer annual or bulk discounted subscriptions. Suggestions: you can make a difference by adding an option to watch movies or just movie songs. Bollywood movies have a lot songs which are sometimes worth than watching whole movie.. Think about it.."
"This app is really good but there are still some problems. The first thing is that although there is So much content on this platform, most of the good blockbuster stuff is not available in it for example only a few marvel movies are available and for is to watch them, we must take subscription of other platforms which makes it harder. You cannot download movies etc on apple devices which is a bummer, there are also some errors that come occasionally and you should make your content stay longer."
"Everytime I click on the ""Next Episode"" button, the app logs me out and I have to login again. At first I thought it was a glitch but I noticed it happens everytime I either click on ""Next Episode"" or ""Skip Intro"". Netflix has to update this app to fix this bug."
I have single profile. But application forces me to choose my the only profile every start. It's con. Usually for movies are available very limited number of languages and subtitles. I can't really understand why not allow me watch movies any languages I want. But in the same time when I'm abroad I get other languages list available for the same movies. Everything else looks fine.
"One irritating thing is when I'm looking for something new and come across the synopsis that just gives actors or something, and hardly any more information, if at all. Can we please get some actual hints on what things are about? I may be unusual about it, but idk why anybody would be drawn into something just because of who's involved."
Everything is fine with this app. Except one thing there is literally no option to change video quality during streaming which looks like small thing but it is one major problem. Please do something for this or give us option like other streaming platforms. Thank you.
Used to love this app but now it tells me connection error even though I'm connected to wifi. Seems like Netflix is going down hill. If this dosnt fix soon I'll be going to hulu or HBO max or back to prime. I'm also extreamly tired of getting into shows then find out it's been canceled. Also your short episode series are getting old an annoying.
"I'm sure only me got same problem before. First of all, my Netflix suddenly force close every time I open it. It mean I can't reach my account to subscribe and I thought my account got hacked or ban. Lol. But after I reset my account on this Netflix and set it back, my account back to normal. It mean no force close every time I open it. Just get boring see all old movie... Some movie already 3 years still no new season to continue the story, feel like wasting time waiting and watching."
"Please bring back the old review system, the new one doesn't give you much information. Everytime i want to watch something i still have to Google the title to check for reviews. Also please try and change the interface, it has been the same confusing interface since i started two years ago."
"I love Netflix!! It has your favorite shows/movies and all of that. Although, the reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because of you guys keep canceling/ removing shows! One time when I was on vacation, I was watching Full House and trust me I love it! As soon as I came home from vacation, I went on my TV and saw that it was removed. I was so dissapointed. There are many other shows I know of that have been cancelled or removed on Netflix too. Please stop canceling/ removing shows!"
I really think this is a decent app it's pretty good but I was watching a movie and it's original language/audio was Spanish so I changed it to English and I still heard Spanish echoing through the English and it was so hard to understand what they were saying so I just turned my sound all the way down and read the subtitles instead very annoying please fix this!
"Solid streaming service but there needs to be a global setting for enabling/disabling subtitles, as having to turn them off each episode is beyond tedious. I assume it's a quick fix but it would greatly improve the user experience."
"I would give it a 5 star but I'll give it 3 because of too many reasons. 1. Some shows that netflix didn't make like anime and maybe some Tv shows, aren't completed. I sometimes watch incomplete shows in other sites because of that. 2. The subtitles. Sometimes in a foreign show, you guys don't add a subtitle when they are speaking in english. Which is not nice because sometimes we can't understand foreigners speaking english. And 3. Inaccurate subs. I'ts too long now sorry. But thats all!"
"App is good. Duh!! But the recent update has something messing in it. A glitch or crash maybe idk. The screen goes completely black on the main homepage screen. Plus the old UI worked fine as well. Do something about the crashes, its irritating!!"
"I have used Netflix for less than 1 week and I've been getting an error message saying ""Sorry we could not reach the Netflix service. Please check Network settings to connect to an available network and use Netflix(15001). Please how can I troubleshoot this? I have deleted and reinstalled app and it's same. To think that I was really excited to have joined the Netflix gang. I'm not happy at all."
Lack of app settings. The last thing I want on my phone is that floating window of a show playing over my icons. Allow me to disable the mini view or enable it at will. The app works well except for the lack of options within the application settings.
"Great app especially for a soap viewer, however only 3 stars due to closed captioning that I can't disable, and that doesn't follow the dialogue. It has delays of dialogue even into the very many commercials. Glitches and the 27 ( minimum) ads per episode should be addressed. It's handy, but has a whole lot of issues."
I tried to go into the app but it won't load anything please fix
"App tends to crash or freeze frequently. It's hard to watch shows when you are constantly being bombarded with ads, short clips, and mobile games. I prefer the old app where everything was streamlined. I also cannot stand the trailers automatically playing when I just want to read the synopsis. It is frustrating."
"This new layout sucks, don't push us to see what you want. Have the only view be optional. I ca t find any of my shows and I habe to scroll past everything you want me to see. I can't even find my recently watched or list. The cards are to big and can only see one at a time versus the previous slide view."
"It would be nice to have a chance to adjust the video resolution every time I watch something. Okay, I know I can so that in the settings, but again, this does not work in my mobile app and I am watching the video in some really bad 240p quality, and nothing changes that. I would at least like to watch my shows in 480p-720p in my phone and 720p on my laptop, but the settings do not help me with that and I cannot regulate the quality on my own. Please make it easier to pick the resolution."
"The app is very good the best to be honest but many shows are still not available and you should give some non Netflix original shows for free and there are many glitches and bugs in the app I don't know if those are only happening to me but still please solve it and that's why I think that my 150 rupees was not worth it so I am canceling the membership for now but if you add more shows, movies and animes and fix the glitches and bugs I will come back for sure"
"I have really enjoyed the up until a week back, the move starts to skip at some point. The image also freezes but the audio continues to play. I have updated the app and my android system to the latest version and I still have this problem please fix it. Thank you"
I love netflix and I watch it all the time but apparently my friends have some movies on their netflix that I don't have. I thought Netflix was one thing. I have updated it and deleted and redownloaded it and it still doesn't have it. I would like to know how to fix it.
Netflix always been my go-to for movies and series. Recently for about 2 weeks now its been loading and stopping at 24%. I cant even get to see anything. During this pandemic is the worst time for loading problems.
I pay for you but you don't have more Hindi dubbed shows ü•π
"I suppose the playback is reasonably good. However, captions are very hard to read because there is no option for a black background to contrast the white text. This makes watching content in other languages very frustrating."
"Use App all the time, would rate 5 but recently, with most recent update, app logs me out of account after each show ends/backing out of a show, using on a Note 8. Reinstalled app, and reset password to try and fix issue. Most likely bug with app. Will rerate once fixed. Thank you"
"Get nothing compared to USA version, still worth it for some of the shows like Stranger Things, Santa Clarita Diet, Dark etc. However the app should offer the same shows and tv shows in any country. We need films like USA get such as Spiderman into the spider verse. The app definitely needs some improvement outside of the US in the content that it offers."
"Really...I have to use the same wifi with my family, so that I can use my account üòê"
The app almost never saves my progress to show which episodes I've already watched so I have to remember it and skip to where I was up to. Just a little bug I find annoying. Otherwise it's good apart from the content range in NZ which is rather awful.
"In terms of UI, it's pretty convenient. But I just wanna suggest in terms of security. Maybe you could add multi factor authentication if new device is trying to login using my account. Or if there are changes being made on the account settings. Like sending OTP or code to verify the change. Hope you'll consider."
I don't know why dut i can't download the app i am very co nfuse how to fix it
Netflix Canada free online TV watching via ROKU PREMIERE devices is available in Canada
"Hi Team, I am using Netflix from my mobile app where I found a strange thing while in download options. There should be multiple options while download. Say like Download All or Cancel All. Its very hard for us while downloading or canceling the download since I have to select each single episodes or movies while perform such operation for dowloading or cancelling. Kindly look for this matter in our next app updation. Do please let me know if you have any further questions."
"Please do give option for high quality video on lower end phone, it doesnt make sense that Youtube able to give 1080p experience while Netflix can't, the video quality is blurry and i can't raise it as it have restriction on some phones. My phone model is Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 (Snapdragon 636). PS. Yes, i prefer watching on phone instead of TV or PC, and yes i have the Ultra HD plan"
"there's issue on my device, it wont logged in on my mobile phone"
NETFLIX is no longer available on this device Whats the mean of it.....how can I resolve this TEAM PLEASE GUIDE
"Dark video playback. Brightness is controlled by app and overrides phone. Hard to see video even with in app brightness on left slid all the way up. When I try to turn up phones Brightness, it's at half and won't move. I get a message saying it's controlled by Netflix. Phone is Samsung Note 20 Ultra."
"Excellent selection of content, automated collection of money without my permission. Add a pay now button and stop the automated collection of money not everyone can afford to spare. I need to count my money before I spend it. Let me pay when I can afford to and quit charging to switch bill dates. Use an Ebay style payment option."
"I have always loved Netflix and I enjoy their original content, but recently I have been unable to adjust the brightness settings to my own liking, it auto adjusts them on original shows, its insanely annoying. Other than that the app is great"
"Netflix itself is pretty good, but the main issue I have with it is that on my phone, for about 10 seconds at a time, anything that I watch will drop in framerates to like 2 fps. It is really difficult to watch shows on my phone because of this, and I really hope this gets fixed as I cannot find any fixes online."
"Only issue I have is the cancelation of shows after getting people hooked. Hard to want to start a show if most that you liked were cut short with no ending just a cliff hanger. The Netflix originals are great but most are 1 ,2 maybe 3 seasons long then cut off and canceled with unanswered questions. Soon no one will pay for Netflix ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"Cast icon keeps vanishing. Near impossible to disconnect from chromecast. Autoplays things and cannot be stopped. Can't prevent full screen recommendations. Continue watching row keeps moving. If you don't know exactly what you want, is useless."
It was all good untill i couldn't sign in on my netflix anymore. I had to delete cuz i didnt have any space and when i downloaded it again every time i pressed the quick sign in thing the app would just close and i tried several times and it just happend over and over again so i delete it and downloaded it again and the same thing happened plsss fix it cuz i want to watch this series that its about to go next month
"I don't understand why we need Wi-Fi for this app I have the premium account, and I still need Wi-Fi, and even if you have Wi-Fi, it says there is none and takes so long to connect, we really need an offline mode to this app. And Netflix also seems to be losing many streaming rights to other services I have to pay for 4 streaming services now, and another problem is that the anime on Netflix never seems to have the full show or start of the show in the middle of it! It's annoying."
Thr application is great and quality is perfect. But it was so annoying that the library is limited by the where you are!! Some movies are family movies and i cannot see them!! Very disappointed with that.. And i found another app that provides unlimited library with the latest movies of 2019.
The subtitles being on is very annoying so you have to stop what your watching and turn it off. No way in the settings to permanently turn them off. Also when using bluetooth headphones the sync is out by about 5 seconds. have uninstalled and reinstalled but still no good. very frustrating üò§
"Great service, app going down hill. The latest update fixed the issue of the brightness slider not working. However, now it simply shows everything very dark. With the slider all the way up, everything is still incredibly dark. I have Hulu, HBO max, and Amazon video. This is the only app with brightness and color grading problems. Sucks b/c it makes the app almost unusable"
"The app is really good for watching movies but not all of them are shown....for example twilight is not on Netflix. And once the second part of the movie arrives the first part is gone and worst of all, when you pay for the movies, why are downloads taken away in a few days. They should be downloaded like in YouTube ."
I love how you get to choose the Movie and TV show you want to watch. I hate constantly have to pause what I am watching just so the closed captions can be off. Could you make an update where the closed captios can be turned off when you are watching something in your own language and turn it back on when you are watching something in a different language?
"What the heck is going on, I have had a good experience so far however bubble popping up saying this title is not temporarily available to view please try again later or try something else"" so I try to watch something else and every single item that I click the same bubble pops up!I have tried restarting the app I have tried logging out and logging back in I have even unlock downloaded and read downloaded the Netflix app and nothing seems to work! COME ON. any help? Get it together ..."
App is very upgraded and covenient to use.All genres are well categorised.There are so many options to connect with any device. But the major issue is that new videos are not available.Old incomplete seasons are still incomplete.New seasons are not available.It is getting boring now.
Recently I'm having some problems with the app. While I'm playing something and leaving the app and dealing with some other media app and while completing that task the netflix app just plays in the background and it's really annoying. I'm not able to anything else while Playing something on Netflix
"Having issues with the payment option. I've contacted customer care but they weren't able to help either. My card is working on other sites and I have been making online transactions with the same card but it's not working on Netflix. There should be more methods to make a payment (PayTm, G-Pay ,etc.)."
"Why don't you have the filter option anymore? They only left for a few weeks. The option was great, I could filter with the original language of the movies and series The only bad thing was that depending on the colors of the movie that was on the app's home screen, it hid the filter and the search button"
"I'll give the app 5 stars if you add a setting which will allow me to hide the new floating ""Play Something"" button. Or just take it away. I don't mind the one in the bar with all the other buttons, but the one floating separately is highly annoying. I know you're trying to highlight the new functionality, but this is a bit too much."
"Netflix please improve your app. Sometimes a released episode of a show does not appear on a list. Therefore, I can not even download it to watch offline. I can only access it from a continue section. However, from this section I can only access it online which is not convenient for me. I hope you will fix this issue soon..."
Customer service wasnt helpful at all... I was trying to inquire my problem (netflix audio is out sync) but either they will recommend me to restart my device so they could not chat with me anymore or just log out. One customer service agent immediately cut our conversation after saying my account have several attempts on changing the verification...i wanted to explain that i have solved this problem with an agent since i changed my location but voila they wanted me to rate the conversation.....
"It's has trouble when I started smart mirrioring on my smart tv. You can't see the video but it has an audio . I always thought that the tv has broke or there something wrong on my tv, but how many times I restart it. And on/off the tv and the mirrioring share. There's nothing happen, only black video show in the screen ."
There's an issue where if I'm trying to watch a film or show on here mainly movies....and I try to skip forward of backward....for some reason the footage Freezes while the dialog is still moving ahead which means the dialog isn't in sync with the footage...also the footage freezes when I reenter a film from where I left off...fix this now netflix plz
Eh you have to pay so eh but movies and tv shows are lit some are kinda mid tho i wish they would stop removing iconic shows or movies live girl no
"I keep trying to play Different shows and films, but only the audio is there. It keeps crashing and is annoying to try and sort out. Netflix is Great as a whole, but I dont recommend using it on your phone at all"
Only problem with the app is that it sometimes will not let you switch to another profile from the main profile. My 8 year old daughter cannot access her movies now. Other than that it's a great app and it's worth the price you can watch on 4 devices for the same price that you would pay for a unlimited premium account on one device on Hulu
Usually i download movies and web-series but i got fed up of that process. Thus i eventually bought a Netflix account and Downloaded it in my new phone. But don't know why I'm facing the often occurring problem currently that's screen is black. All i can hear audio and watch subs. Nothing at the image. I complained about it to the seller of the account. Also i had reinstalled the app after cleaning the cache. Haven't broke any rule i reckon
The App doesn't support split screen on my tablet (HUGE disappointment and now I can't use the mobile website to watch my shows instead....well that's just lovely. Overall I love Netflix but either make the app support split screen mode OR let me watch it by the website WITHOUT needing the app.
"Netflix is a good app it's just that it removes my favorite shows everytime and why should I choose a region. When I try to find the movie that I watched before, I try to find it again it says it is not in your region. But overall it is a good app at least there a other shows I can choose from so I give it 3 stars."
"Very , very nice app for watching movies and webseries .But the app consume large amount of mobile data so we can't even completely watch a single movie or webseries , which is very, very frustrating üòíüòíüòí. So you should reduce the movies and webseries MB ,and also add some features likes options of 144p,240p ,360p 480p etc . If these features are added these app will be very amazing and excellent üëåüëçüëå.i hope these features will be added. So I am giving these app only 3 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
"On tablet, the app constant bugs when closing netflix to do other things, the small window mode dosent work particularly well and neither does the transition in and out of it. Also subtitles are way too large. Autoplay also dosent work in windowed mode, defeating the whole purpose of using it."
"The app is cool,given the fact that am a series nostalgic.Therefore, the three stars is for the content and its proper functionality.The app has some drawbacks like starting of the shows from the beginning,a lot of data is used when roaming using cellular and finally the app increases its size when you keep using it every now and then."
"Very good but I preferred the 5 star rating scheme. Some sort of comments section add on or feature would be beautiful. I wish there were more shows but the lack of some is understandable. Trigger warning fearure is lacking. It needs full screen coverage or some sort of highlighted box, bc the red line is just inept at capturing attention. more warnings should equal more screen time, and should be audible. If at least the trigger warning is added, I'll give 5 stars."
I paid for my subscriptions (my regular monthly payment) but my account is not popping up. And it's acting as if we have to reselect a plan and go through a trial again and I'm upset that I paid for my monthly subscription but my account is wiped and I can't even get in contact with anyone. I would like to be refunded because I'm not wanting to pay if I'm not getting to watch. And I don't want to end up being charged again for another month. Any progress of shows is gone I can even see titles...
I been a Customer with Netflix for a long time they make millions of dollars off of the people then they raise the price anyways I can't watch any decent shows or movies on there cuz they are from a different country or different language the movies they do play they are so damn old.... then we get into a good episodes found out Netflix can't pick it up the next season and I have to go somewhere else to watch that episode I think I'm fixing to cancel my s***
"Have to delete and reinstall it every 3 times I use it because the screen goes dark as if I ha e my screen brightness on low but I haven't. When I press the cross to make the screen small cos I wanna text for example, whatever is on netix goes bright again. But soon as I've deleted the app its fine for 3 uses. It doesn't happen on my ipad or my husbands iPhone"
"The app has been decent, but wish it had a good casting option. Since the latest update it's crashing a lot and the video stops playing. Even my phone stops responding for a while. Didn't happen before, doesn't happen with any other app so pretty sure it's the Netflix app. Hope this is fixed soon."
"It's has the best movies in it, but I'm very disappointed at the part that some of the series, you don't update, like, We Bare Bears, and especially Attak On Titan, why? I really love aot(attack on titan) we paid for netflix, and I was hoping it had season 3 but I just went to google and just searched for season 3 I had no other choice, I hope you'd update some series, we love watching shows, please update it, please."
"i always watching netflix on phone, but this day my netflix always have ads. the ads change my mood down.."
Hi team. There is some serious issue with your mobile app. Many times I play the videos. I can hear the sound clearly but there are videos only black screen appears in application. I closed the app multiple times and restart it but it work like same. Please resolve issues with your app.
"A decent app but there is loads to improve especially when is a paid subscription and here is what I noticed so far: 1.movies which are suggested in list should have the option to remove the unwanted ones 2. The player should haveore option where you could increase the volume and the brightness of the movie but swiping from the screen (most of other player have that and there is no subscription to pay on some of them) And there is much more, but to much to type......anyway loads to improve....."
"Love Netflix but I'm constantly having the issues with the latest update. Consistently getting device failure, issues with profiles, corrupt downloads etc. Works often but the issues are getting annoying. FYI having the same issues after doing a warranty exchange on my phone and new phone has these issues too. So its definitely not the phone. Note 8."
"Had to turn off notifications. Way too many... 4 today (individually)... and 2 were for the same thing. One was letting me know that it was out and the other one was recommending it to me several hours later. I wouldn't mind useful notifications, but these are not generally that."
Need more options for payment mode.
"The app works fine even when I switch countries, and I'm ok with the fact that some downloaded content can't be used when in other countries. But there is muuuch room to improvement on the ""downloads player"" : you can't skip to the next episode and even when the current episode is over there's no autoplay for the nextüò´üò´"
"Alright, It has a good selection of movies but after about Six month you probably watched everything that intrests you. I mean its not bad for 15$ bucks a month but they are raising the prices for netflix. For some shows ( Mostly animes) They will stop it at the 1st or 2nd season when there are about 6 more seasons left. And they will do some In english and then the other half of animes in a different language. So if your looking for a platform for animes. This is not the app."
I am always losing my connection chrome casting this App. It is not a WiFi issue because I this does not occur with Prime or YouTube. It is very frustrating considering the outlandish subscription fee. I am going to see if deleting and reinstalling fixes the issue and if it does not I will be just fine with Prime Video.
"I hate this app bring back good shows and movies (my little pony, mamma mia, modern family, etc)."
"The app is good when it works, but I have a lot of trouble even opening the app without getting an error. Then it closes again. If it's not that, then I can't access my downloaded content because of more errors. Any time there is an app update or a device update, the only thing I get are errors."
This Review is for the Application not the Content. It has Several Glitches.. 1. When I watch for long time (2-3 hrs.) I can't open the Notification panel. 2. Sometimes I close the app and remove it from recent apps but still it plays in background (only sounds) no popup window. 3. When I complete one episode and click on 'watch next episode' it plays BUT options stop working like I can't change language and subtitles. I'm using Redmi Note 7S Please fix these ASAPüòä
"I was pleased with netflix when I got it and gladly went to premium but my netflix keeps saying I need to update my phone to proceed,which I've done (now all the time,my phone keeps wanting to update,won't stop) it still won't let me access netflix. Whats even more annoying is the fact that I hotspot my phone to my smart TV and the app is gone from my TV. I am unable to watch netflix at all!"
"Doesn't load past Netflix start up screen. Thought maybe it was just a glitch that they were gonna fix over time. Now it's been 2 weeks and still the same with no update. not to mention I've redownloaded more than I should have. loads fine on my note 8 just not on my tab. please fix this, I'd love to be able to watch my shows on my tablet again."
"Hello Netflix India I am a hardcore anime fan and love watching the huge variety of Japanese anime series featuring on Netflix with English subtitles ofcourse. Although the problem is the font of the subtitles is not readable on many episodes and in a white background it is unreadable. So my suggestion would be yo please give us the option of changing subtitles colour or font so we do not miss anything. Until then am giving 3 stars, otherwise it would be 5 stars for the content."
"I hate the fact that nearly every month a series or film has disappeared from the face of the app, i've been using netflix for a good 5 yrs at least and when they took off fairy tail, i wasn't too bothered but once they took off slugterra without the next season it started getting to me, now i find out that sao 2 is gone and i was ready to watch it for a 3rd time but nooo netflix had to take it off please just brimg back some of the series that you got rid of and stick them on kids only or adult"
"I've had netflix for about 3 years & I've enjoyed all the good shows they've played. Though, recently they are doing away with some good shows & adding shows I don't really care much for. I have not unscribed yet but I watch it less and less. So, for this next mo. I will see how it does for me. If it continues with these good shows I hear are being taking off then I may keep netflix. If not I will be letting it go. Sorry Netflix..."
"Great app, but I dislike how the movies I've watched STAY in my ""Continue watching"" category even though I've watched them to the end...more than once. It's starting to pile up making the feature useless as it now has everything that I've watched, including movies I didn't like and don't want to finish...üôÑ"
"Love Netflix. Don't like how the most recent update of the app got rid of the Cast button on the home screen of the app. I like to Cast to my TV before I select an episode or movie on my phone, but I can't find that option anymore."
"App works great for me, just please take off the automatic start watch.... It's annoying when your watching something and scrolling through other stuff.... U land on something and ur attention goes back to the TV and BAM.... Movie changed.... Pointless feature, if I want to watch something I will CLICK on it.. Don't just play titles automatically."
Here i am rating for the quality of app not the quality of content on Netflix. While watching something the video suddenly stops and audio keeps going. Then i have to close the app and reopen it. Fix the problem Netflix. And give us option of playback speed. Some scenes are very slow and i feel like i want to cover it up fast but i can't
The application and content is great but it doesn't support full screen experience with the Samsung Galaxy S10 series. The movie won't go under the front camera which is causing a dead black screen at the top. It would be great to update it.
"It is a good streaming app has a lot of good tv shows and movies but, one major thing that I find annoying is i can't set the video quality that i want to watch in like YouTube it automatically assess the strength of my internet and mostly plays it in low quality that's super annoying pay all that money and watch in super bad quality . Even my internet speed is good its around 50 mbps mostly and ping and all everything is good . So, yeah improve on that NETFLIX üò†üò†."
Yes. Good content at one place. But what irritates me more abt netflix is subscription handling devices. U can pay for mobile & PC bt cannot watch same content on both. U can't download on one & watch on other. In simple words u have to spend double data to watch or download. Infact most of time same content is nt even available to watch on other device. Then what's use of 2 device subscription?? Simple advice Netflix should put separate subscription for each device.
"Netflix picture in picture mode was working fine a few days ago, but since I updated the app it won't allow me to open it in (picture in picture mode). Now evertime I want to reply to someone's text I have to exit Netflix and it's just so annoying. I hope they fix this problem soon."
Used to be great. Now I don't know what is happening when i played on the laptop or phone n chrome cast it to the TV it's all ruined. Everytime i paused everything just went frozen. Can't fast forward or back. Can't even see what's going on on the phone or laptop while it's playing on the TV. Seems very very stupid now!
"I checked it out when Stream fest started and it's all pretty good when looked at the choices available, but the only problem is the price which is steep for a month when compared to Prime. The reduction of price or bringing extra things like netflix Music may make it more worthwhile"
"One particular annoying issue is that the a downloaded video would keep showing as loading. I have to restart the app or my device and then only I get to view a downloaded one or stream something. This happening both in my IOS and android devices. Sometimes I would be watching something and pause it for a bit, then when I resume it will keep saying loading and never play."
"I feel like Netflix lacks the knowledge of how people actually consumes content on their platform and keeps cancelling shows far too early. Because it's a platform where shows doesn't need to be watched asap, some shows will take longer to hit their numbers. Just chill and stop ruining good things As for the app itself, it's fine. Maybe too many useless features makes the app look bloated."
"there are some great series/movies but it seems like netflix says quantity over quality. some shows are great to watch while drawing or doing some other stuff that you don't have to pay attention much. there should definitely be more cult movies/series. other than that a yearly subscription would be great, I'd definitely buy something like that."
"Recently I've had the screen go blank and display nothing more than subtitles, in order for it to return to normal I need to restart my phone. Have uninstalled/reinstalled app but it doesn't seem to help. I have also updated the app. Not ideal"
"I am disappointed in all the loading and restarting it does when I cast Netflix to the TV but I'm not sure if that is the phone or the app, it has been happening to everyone in the house. The wifi does not go out and all of our other streaming apps work just fine."
"Rather good experience overall wth Netflix. Would like an option as to sort series/movies into ""playlists"". I know you can 'add to my list' but there's somethings I'd like to put into different lists so I can find them much easier than scrolling through 'my list' as they seem to get lost, or I just can't find them in there, but overall rather enjoy Netflix. (If only I come up with something as good as this, bet the pays great lmao beats not being any good at anything &not having any money lmao)"
"Good for streaming movies and shows. It's legit. No solid evidence here, but I have heard some stuff about them wavering their prices to make more money but might just be a myth idk. One thing I have to mention though, be careful what shows you get hooked into because there's a change they'll get taken off of Netflix like my favorite show did -.-"
"The audio works perfectly fine, but when I trying to watch the actual video only a black screen appears. I think it's my phone but idk anymore, I uninstalled the app and left it alone for a couple of months, just re-installed the app just to come back to the same problem. Black screen, I don't know what to do anymore :("
I gave three stars because there's no customization for the subtitles. It's hard to watch with white subtitles because you can't read it well when it blends with what you're watching. It's more difficult to tell when it comes to light colored movies or series.
"Behind on the times! Keeping even 1080p behind paywalls will leave the app in last place in the streaming wars. With Chrome no longer supporting surround sound, hopefully a desktop or other app could support this. Haven't checked with HDR yet but I imagine it is also unsupported."
"It's great n all but can we have the ability to edit n organize ""my list""? maybe the option to add a ""his list"" and/or a ""kid list""?? I upgraded to the 2 device plan thinking maybe that would be included but I don't see the edit option.."
"I love to watch netflix and it's my favorite thing to do when I'm bored,but I've come to find out that my friends have some movies on their netflix that I don't. It's weird because I thought netflix was one thing. I've updated it and deleted and redownloaded, but still nothing. I'm not hating on netflix but I would like to know how to fix it."
I'm giving it three stars coz it often crashes when I play downloaded movies. This is the third time I have to reinstall the app. Why is it acting weird like this? It was okay in the past. I waste time and internet connection reinstalling the app and redownloading the movies. Please fix the bugs.
"I'm currently using a revvl 4+ and I'm completely unable to watch any shows on Netflix due to a black screen when I try to stream a show. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and that didn't work, tried going thru the web.. no luck either. Not sure what else I can do.."
"The movies are amazing!! There are a lot of movies to watch. However, when i watch the movie, sometimes it lags like crazy!! When it lags, the audio is still playing but the video doesn't.... please fix this..... please. (My internet is also in perfect speed)."
"hi, from time to time each a few minutes, my video window minimazes without a reason, and when i try to full screen again, it shows a message reading ""playback track failed"" or something like this. i noticed this since I updated my motog6+ to android 9, but im not sure is that. what could be happening?"
"The app is great of course. But whatever the latest update did, it's not working. I can't fast forward without the video freezing while the audio goes on. Have to move backwards until I find a section that is moving."
"The app & widget don't sync with the Netflix site. Whenever I cast to my TV from the widget, I often lose the ability to play or pause; therefore, I have to ""open Netflix"" in order to gain control - with sporadic resumption of where my show is."
It's good but some time Netflix doesn't work and most important thing please available Hindi dubbed of Korean dramas it's a special request please
I dont know its with other people or not but for the past 1 week but Netflix app always hang. I cannot able to see any movie or show. Even if I close the app or uninstall it's still the same. I think it happend because of the update. Please fix this problem otherwise there is no point to have this app if I cannot watch it.
"Besides having issues with double screen or floating screens (so no messaging or playing a game while watching a movie) there isn't much complains. Some dumb features also anoys me. Like having a recommendation for a new serie, hit play and I start seeing the 1st ep of the last season, instead of the first. Also automatic downloads seem dumb. So you have watched 3 seasons of X, we recom watching X so we downloaded the first 3 ep of s1. Also get a proxy to see what you want, specially anime."
"It was good until the most recent update. Now it seems like the phone lose its spot often. Also, the icon to cast only pops up after you click to Play the video. It used to be displayed in other areas which made it easier. I wish i could go back to the last version."
"Well the reason I'm giving this app nothing but a three star is because it lately started bugging on my phone. If I have been using my phone for over 30 minutes and then try playing a movie in the app, it won't play() after restarting my device as guided by the help page of the official website, movie I want to play will then play but it will cause my phone to restart a twice or thrice on its own. I thought the issue is my phone but I discovered that it's the Netflix app alone."
"Since 2~3 weeks ago, I couldn't watch Netflix via screen mirroring on TV anymore. The video didn't show, but the hovering buttons are visible, and the sound is normal. Even after this update, I still can't. Before this, I always watch via screen mirrorimg with no problem. Please help."
I love Netflix but this last update they messed up big time with auto dimming. I've adjusted every setting possible and it dims to completely dark when watching Netflix in full screen. It shows up fine on the main app homepage or if the video is in a pop-up but full screen it's impossible to watch.
"I love Netflix , it doesn't consume a lots of internet data , great quality, sound and everything but I'll give it only 3 start cause of it CONTENT, Netflix need to update new movies especially horror movie..my main reason i purchased Netflix was horror movie and there's not even a single horror movie that i can say yeah its worth watching....all horror movies sucks. It literally feels like I'm wasting my money...."
I am really disappointed. I have made my payment for this month but it still has problem in updation of the payment.it's been more than a week but in app it shows I should make my payment on next month April 14 . when it will be corrected.Can you correct it or not I have already made the payment it's waste of my money
"Audio quality isn't the best. Have it at 50 percent, and it sounds like it is at 20-30 percent volume. Have to have at 60 to at least get my full surround audio quality."
"The app is great, though you have a limited point of downloads, and it doesn't have the whole of a series and doesnt have all movies and series, but no ads or anything, I just wish it would add movies that I would like to watch like 5 feet apart or the new lion king or IT and IT2, but pretty good app."
Why is Netflix keep going up now almost 25 dollars I think this is going to be my last month with them ..the shows are wack I watch hulu and Disney plus more
"The new app update blows, you can no longer find ""continue watching"". It opens straight into a list of what's new and popular, and then you're only other option is ""Your list"" but if the show you've been watching isn't in your list then you have to search for it in search bar. Just kind of annoying."
"Since the latest update I can no longer cast Netflix onto my Chromecast. The cast button does not appear. I have tried uninstalling and installing this app, I've deleted my Chromecast from my phone and set it up again, but it still isn't working. The cast button will not appear no matter what I try"
"I use a chromebook, and after this last update when I select a movie to read about it the screen looks like it's optimized for a truly mobile device such as a phone. One thin strip of info and video in the middle, and two large swathes on the sides. Netflix.......what's up with this? It looks absolutely horrible."
"I wish they had the speed up function for the TV app. I even tried casting it on my TV from my phone, but the speed up function only works on my phone. I don't like keeping the app on my phone because I have too much apps on my phone that take up a lot of storage space and I rarely stream shows and movies when I'm out of the house (I use that time to listen to music or podcasts). I also wish it would just show my go-tos instead of trying to push new shows on me."
"The app and content is great but there is some issues I like to raise,that I am facing with content language is not being displayed on any video detail page we have to play and check the available languages. Secondly the same issue with recommendation on 'Play Something' I am getting recommendation of movies which have only one language which is not known to me then why I am getting that recommendation."
"I stopped using Netflix for a while, just resumed today and it's the same old movies that were there that are still there. No new additions of series like the originals, legacies, etc. It's like new movies are barely added regularly."
"Problem is with white colour of subtitle. It is always difficult (impossible) to read subtitle when background of video is also of white colour. When video is of light colour then it makes to put more stress upon eyes to read white subtitle, causing irritation in eyes and weakens eyesight. Black base for white colour subtitle is suggestion from me. Otherwise it is a good app."
"Too MANY MA rated with dominant use of ""f"" bomb. Too many senseless sex scenes, Tearing off clothing. unrealistic. Want more programs and movies with a real plot. Mysteries, police shows. too many foreign programs. Netflix is moving away from its roots. i like a good thriller but don't need the swearing and sex. need better writers or those choosing the programing to be more discrete toward the old generation."
It's 50 50 they need to put an option to pay yearly or as many months ahead as you want this whole having to buy gift cards just to get a few months ahead not being able to pay your payments before the date is ridiculous also when you trying to find a movie on there whatever movie that you say you want to watch it throws you at anything else besides that movie I have never found the movie that I want to watch on Netflix by typing it in the search bar so there are improvements they can make
Have a proplem currently when it just won't work. When I watch a video it will remain on a loading screen until eventually I will get an error message where I have to click to close. This has been going on for four days now. Otherwise it's a great app
"Netflix offers some great shows, so it really sucks when you start a series like marco polo, sense8 or dark matter and find out they were canceled after season 3. Could also use some more documentaries. Otherwise, stream quality is excellent and subtitles are on point"
Like every other Android app this app is inferior compared to the iOS version. I never had any issues with the iOS version. The app kept forcing me back to the home screen while i was browsing. It's so annoying to keep scrolling back to where I was. I wonder if Android apps would ever work like iOS apps.
"I LOVE the fact there are no ads but a lot of the shows that are good offen get removed and replaced with ones that I often don't watch, it would be good if we could select ones we don't want to get removed and the one that we do want to get removed it would take a while to get it sorted but it would make this app perfect!"
I don't have a smart TV need this device for other reasons I just brows I had a few good movies we'd like to watch and I think I have the name of them right it was only like previews or trailers on DVDs I have this it is very good at Netflix I mean it's well worth money you have no other service and I'm certain you're very competitive with anyone else you need this and DirecTV and whoever's out there providing cable services.
"The app is great for watching movies but I paid $16 to watch a specific movie called ""Al Hayba"" but as I'm watching and I noticed the other seasons were not on the app there was only one season. To help make the app better for the users Netflix developers must include all seasons for any movie they decide to add to Netflix."
"Enjoying Netflix with the range of movies and series it have, although when it comes to historic series I prefer to access an era after era (i.e., Dirilis Ertugrul is followed up by Kurulus Osman, but until now I have been able to access that), I understand the situation of purchasing rights but it's been long now and Kurulus Osman has got an additional season. The other problem I face with the App it likes to freeze when I am watching offline downloads and it irritates."
"I love the Netflix interface. But recently I've noticed, netflix app on my android cannot sync with my Bluetooth speaker. Youtube has no issues. So, that's how I know there's something wrong w the app. I hope they can figure out what's wrong and fix it."
"New to this app. Installed on xbox one x. Audio is not synced with image, seems to be slightly ahead which is annoying. I have the app on my smart TV and this is fine but I can't enjoy the surround sound this way. Content seems OK but not sure I'll keep my subscription for more than a few months."
"dear netflix,Inc. I really loved netflix but there are things that I want to complain about. 1.the quality switch. sometimes when i watch movies and tv shows the quality would switch to really bad for a while. then comes back to normal. 2.selection. it has most of the movies I love but where's kung th panda three? the yugioh movies.all the good stuff that i have rented from redbox.netflix doesn't really have.. those are things I complain about."
"Unable to remove watched series from the list. It still persists on the watching list. Usually it automatically disappears after watching, but it is in some loop and continues the series all over again. It will be good if it can fixed."
Just got my s9 phone yesterday after upgrading from an s7. Netflix used to work fine on my s7 and used almost no battery when streaming to my chromecast but i just cast a 90minute movie on my s9 and lost 50% of battery whereas on my s7 it would've been around 5%???? Ps. Battery life on the s9 for the day far surpassed my s7 before netflix???
There is no MCU AND DC movies even in free apps marvel movies are available but other movies and shows are good that's why I'm giving 3 stars
The new way that they did stuff is not good and the subtitles are always on (please fix this)
I give this App three Stars because some Shows disappears and i can no longer find them. And sometimes seasons are missing in the series most of things i want to watch are not on Netfix. When there are new updates it doesn't change anything. The more you watch netflix the more you see that it's missing some Movies. But apart from all of that the app is not that bad.
"Gives away the plot/scenes with it's ever changing thumbnails. Auto plays when browsing a programs info, when removing from my list, and from continue watching. Soo many flashing black boxes when scrolling. Hard to remove shows from My List because the check mark keeps coming back. On certain shows if you change the language the playback speed increases or decreases and the audio is distorted."
"After this update I can't watch Netflix on my smartphone using wi-fi, only data. I'm able to watch Netflix on my laptop or on my TV using wi-fi, so the wi-fi is not the problem... Maybe something about the recent update is interfering with the conection! Please help!"
"Netflix is an amazing app but some of my problems is some of the movies or series that I want to watch is not there and this day I was gonna watch something but when I opened the app it was logged out I don't even know why and how even though I didn't logged it out and when I was logging in again it always says ""Incorrect password"". Dear netflix please fix this bug or problem as soon as possible Thank you.."
"I do appreciate the app and Netflix, but the app has a lot of glitch's. For example on my device (OnePlus 6t) it's very inaccurate when showing which episodes I have watched (underlined in red). One series may be accurate, a different series, totally missing the red indicator. FYI, I cast to my TV. Also please stop pushing your PC agenda!"
"All over it is great. But a recent issue is occurring to me and many of my friends that while I forward or backward video for 10 seconds, the video is getting stuck while the audio is playing still. Then I have to close the video or even the app and then start again. Please fix this bug ASAP. It is so frustrating."
"I used to give 5 star to netflix....lots of movies..series..... but this past weeks ive been experiencing hard time to watch in it...the app always having failure...cannot connect to server.... il uninstall then install...update the app...then download something to watch...then when im done....my break is over.... my used to ""stress reliever"" at work is now giving me stress somehow......‚òπ please fix this issue...thanks!!"
Its Netflix but it won't get the new series of miraculous ladybug for my children and it won't download anymore then 6 episodes of the Garfield show and there not that long and it only downloads one movie it sucks they should let us download more then just a movie or six episodes of the Garfield show otherwise its pretty good like on disenchantment its great but should have more episodes of it (disenchantment).
"My problems are when you download and stream at the same time, and also it goes 360 hp below even though my internet wifi is strong (I even replug it for 2 times and check the other apps)... PLS FIX THIS! But overall, it was nice and a pleasurable experience for family bonding"
Very limited movies. On top that a lot of movies and series content is blocked off for regional purposes giving you the illusion that you have a large library but in reality you only have access to like a quarter of Netflix.
"Again and again the same TV series movie comes out. Each time each one is actually better. Because TV series movies are already seen. For example, it would have been much better if the TV series movie of two or three years ago or the TV series movie of five years ago had been shown like this. In this way, it would be better to come forward one by one.need More content add.need all week update lots of movie, tv series etc."
There should be a button for us to remove shows from our Continue Watching list. I finished a few series bit they just reset to the 1st season and it's an eyesore and it would help us who just viewed the pilot out of curiosity but has no intention of going forward. Hope you do something about it.
"The new update doesn't do picture in picture for me on my note 8 and the new update for my smart tv is not accepting my password. It always says invalid. And when I remove the update and set it back to factory settings, it works again."
"Why can't one in one's profile solidify that ALL content should a.l.w.a.y.s be dubbed in 1 default language (or original language) and a.l.w.a.y.s be subbed in 1 default language (or never be subbed at all)?!?! I'm sick and tired of one English-produced movie starting with English audio, but then the next English-produced movie for some weird reason starting with Dutch audio. I wanna put in my profile that I wanna watch all movies and series in their original language!!! And subbed in English!"
Many times I just tap on play and it's turn into loading page but video never played even after 30 minutes so I've to uninstall Netflix and install it again then its rare chance to play the video. it's a very bad experience for me that's why you've lost 2 star from me
Netflix is great. I've always loved it but lately my downloads suddenly disappear and then I have to re-download everything again. Please correct that and everything will be perfect.
Im giving 3 stars coz there is only few options of payment method.you should have to add the UPI payment method coz my card is not allowing to pay online through it.so if there is UPI payment method you add then im able to pay and watch...and many more peoples like me who is not able to use their cards but they can use UPI but you didn't added that option of payment.even many other streaming apps have had this option. otherwise Netflix making great series movies. Thanku you
"I love the app just the control panel is bugged on my samsung phone. I click, it comes up as usual, but when I click again, only the brightness disappears. It will disappear after a while, but its still a major bug. Please fix."
"Decent service, sadly not much of a selection of shows or movies that id ever watch, not sure how many normie shows are on here since I dont watch western media. That coupled with having to wait until a series finishes before you can watch hold back this streaming service."
The video just keeps freezing over and over again while the audio keeps going...... and the video quality is at it's lowest even when I'm connected to the wi-fi..... never expected this from netflix. Please work on this issue
"It keeps glitching on my phone, I tried to reinstall it but it still kept glitching. It then came up with a screen with randomly placed X's on it. Please fix this. Also please reply so I know it is being handled."
Subtitles automatically come on and when you turn them off - the show stops streaming every 15 - 20 minutes automatically. Can you please fix. I would like to watch a show without subtitles and without it closing every 20 min. It is very annoying.
"Last update causes the app to crash and not load, all it does is crash and say restart your device and try again. This is purely bs. Pay for a service and then it gets wonky. This is not the first time an update causes crashes. And it usually takes them a Month to fix them with an update to the failed update."
"I always watch netflix, but since I changed my new phone I'm not been able to watch netflix, returns that couldn't reach netflix service (-1001), every other app works just fine. Please if you could see this bug for me I appreciate, I desperately need to watch my show on my cellphone. Thank u"
To only have the option of going back 30 secs and no option of going forward while casting is one of the dumbest ideas and designs. 10 sec each way would be the logical choice.
Latest update has subtitles on as default and when I turn them off my settings aren't saved. Update: I had to delete my profile and create a new one to remove the subtitles. Now it's working fine. So I've upped the stars.
"I think you have a great streaming service, it's just that I find it constantly annoying how you remove shows and movies from your app. Or that Hulu has other shows and movies that you don't, and I really don't want to have two subscription services."
Please fix the play options on the screen when you start or pause a video. It stays on for atleast 6 secs before going away. Earlier a tap on the screen would make them disappear but now its annoying. You are always watching 6 secs with play-pause- seek icons after a pause or replay.
7 days ago I subscribed the Netflix. It was going smoothly until today 29th July. For some reason my smart TV could not open the nextflix channel. The screen was blank and black. There's nothing to pop up. I request immediate attention and help. Thank you in advance
"Things must have REALLY gone down hill at their IT/UX department. While streaming the app asks if you want to play the next episode while in the middle of playing an episode. The app then has to be reset in order to pause, and sometimes when you reset the app it starts playing the next episode even if the episode being played just started. And the fact that it keeps asking if you're still watching in the middle of episodes interrupting continuity kinda clinches the downhill slide of Netflix UX."
My app updated a few months ago. Ever since I get an error saying it is unable to play video when I'm watching something (5.7). Would like to know how to fix this as I loved the app before and it worked great. Ever since it updated I've been having this issue.
In the past 4 years I gave went from paying $13.99 to 21.99 a month. Compared to other streaming services they are very expensive. I could get 2 other streaming services that has a lot more to offer than Netflix. Other services comes with more than one service. A lot more for your money. As soon as I'm finished watching a series that I'm almost done with I'm probably going to be gone. Sure they have some Netflix orgional but so do other streaming services that you can't watch on Netflix.
Video stream freezes frequently while audio output is perfectly fine. This problem pops up with attempts to fast forward or leaving/returning to app. Internet/data connection is perfectly fine. I'm assuming it's a problem with the TMobile variant S9.
"I have a Pixel 4a on 13, and I cannot get the app to stop overriding the device brightness. I've done all the tricks and steps to try and rectify this but nothing works. It is VERY bright and there is no way to turn that down in the app or through the device. Would love it if this was fixed!"
"I logged in to Netflix after long time now, just to know that the downloads does not happen in the background. When the app is in use, I am able to download the content. Else, the download speed drops abruptly. Please fix it."
"It would be great if Netflix rechecks the subtitles of each series/movies before broadcasting. Especially Thai language, I found a lot of mistakes and some dialogues no subtitles at all. I always watch Japanese animation and have bad experience with subtitles in many of them."
"Horrible ! After cancelling the service Netflix still charged my credit card for more than what it cost causing an overdraft on my account. Called customer service and the person,who seemed to lack intelligence, kept repeating that it was our fault they charged us. No explanation or any effort to resolve this issue. Now I have to dispute this charge through my bank. If you sign up for Netflix be ready for a hassle when you cancel. I would give negative 5 stars off possible."
"Picture in picture mode does not work on Android 11, even when it's allowed in settings. The continue watching list does not automatically update to the last watched episode/time. Instead, it remains a few episodes behind."
"Very useful app because the k dramas that I like are available. However, I noticed that there are some scenes on a certain episode were deleted. And also when I close the app, the video will play itself on the background."
"It works great on my phone, but I've gotten a chromebook, and it won't even open up the app, it says there's an error. It would be nice if this could be fixed, if so, I will probably rate 5 stars, for this is the only problem I have with it (So far)"
"Not a lot of movies or shows that are interesting to watch (there are some that are great though), often freezes, rarely syncs and keeps on saying error when I try to open it. Had to switch to the web"
"The App video player stuck all the functionality except of going back to homepage and, although video kepts playing and i can't forward it, increase brightness, volume, pause and play etc. I have to quite the app to make it work smoothly Looking forward for having good content and this problem to be solved"
The costs are quite high and outrageous but this app still has the most movies and shows you would enjoy watching. I have every streaming service and yes a few of my favorite shows are on paramount and prime video but the selection on netflix remains pretty well over the top for streaming services.
"I want the option to choose the qaulity of the video irrespective of the speed of my internet. When I press the home button and the video squeezes into a tiny box which plays in the background, the box stops responding."
"It's solid but recently it's been acting up by not saving progress and returning to the middle of previous episodes but apart from that streaming is solid, the occasional blip every now and again but I guess that's to be expected."
"Can't remove movies or series from 'my list'. I go in my list, I open one of the titles in my list and on details page it doesn't even show that its marked for my list. I can no longer add to my list too. Every thing else is wonderful."
"Netflix is a good app to watch movies but I am concerned with security of the account. I hope they can separate the password for the manage accounts and supplementary accounts. I just learned that anyone with password can change parental controls, billing info, and even change the mobile number and netflix password."
"Great service but problematic app. Constant stuttering when watching shows, even on a fast WiFi connection, requiring a hard restart of the app every 20 minutes or so. Also no clear way to pass feedback back to the developers."
Good app On my Phillips smart tv I have to keep unplugging the tv after watching netflix for an extended period of time. So after a few hours I have to unplug it gets the -100 error. So it's annoying. How can this be fixed. I've already uninstalled and reinstalled
"Everything runs good, but one annoying thing is, when I stream series through chromecast and i want to play next episode, there is no play next button in the UI. That could be changed. I can't select next on my TV either bcs it's older model."
"Idk if its with my phone or what, but everytime i minimize the app bc of some call or something, as soon as the call ends it automatically starts still in minimized state...so basically even when m not watching it...I'm listening it üòê.... N also I've the mobile subscription and the vid quality is awful, agn idk if thats on purpose but c'mon they can provide us with a lill better quality if not awesome üòí .....other than that all good.."
I was watching my favourite show when it suddenly said that I can't play the video or i need to restart my device. The problem is I already done that couple of times and the problem still the same. I think my device working very well since I watch another show at another apps. Please fix this matter or it will such a waste since I pay to become a member.
I really hope netflix starts allowing people to use the app in picture in picture mode. Also since the last update I keep getting errors in playback as well as while logging saying that can't reach Netflix. Hope they fix this soon.
"The movies are good. But I would like to report crashes telling ""sorry we could not reach the netflix service, please try again later"" and ""try restating your phone"" it works but it happens really often. It wasn't like this in the past. I hope you try to fix it."
Its ohk but there is a glitch like when i am trying to log in when i am connected to my wifi its not getting loggged but after that when i choose mobile data to login its logged in so.... Its not enough while streaming when i am watching it on wifi 2 or 3 days after that its auto logged off every twice day i have to login with my pass so please fix this glitch or may be bug after all love to watch Netflix there are many options to choose zetflix but netflix its self has a flex please remove bug
I didnt like the brightness bar cause it is fully manual and sometimes in dark places i accidentally touch the top of the bar and it makes my eyes burnt. I wish there were a way in the settings to remove the bar and back to the old way brightness setting.
The video will stop midway through and wont let me restart it. I have to go all the way back to the main screen with all the shows and then click on it to restart the show. Its annoying. Otherwise I love this app.
"Latest version of this app is having some major issues playing video. While audio and subtitles keep going, the video keeps freezing. Netflix works fine on my desktop so assuming it is an app issue. Please fix."
"Much improved chromecast performance, though over the past couple of months, all browse / search actions have become excruciatingly slow. The android 'this app is not responding' message gets triggered all the time when navigating content."
It's got awesome programs and movies. But lately sometimes the sound disappears. I have to either restart the movie or have to go back a 10mins. Its very annoying please fix. Then I might consider reinstalling app
The scroll function in the My List is not up to mark. Whenever I scroll down and open any of the movie or series and then go back to the list it takes me to the top of the list and I have to scroll down again. Is it just my phone or the app. Because this is really irritating.
It was working perfectly on previous phone S9. Now on Note 9. The movies are very dark to the extent that u can only see the translation . The previews works fine but when I enter the movie it turns dark?!!!
"very nice, except the fact that you guys took a lot of the good movies off of NETFLIX and now i have to pay for the movies on hulu, disney plus, or apple tv. i would really like if you guys also would get back most of your good shows. netflix is one of my favorite apps to watch movies and shows on. please get some of you guises good movies back, please and thanks! -kenadee"
"Some of the features of video player like screen lock and unlock, click based screen options while video plays doesn't work proper in my mobile. I use android version 9. May be the app require proper validation on most of the android devices used by users."
"The app is pretty good but it has a mute bug. When you check the sound via the app it's always on mute even though the actual sound is not. When you turn down the sound it goes straight to mute, to reflect the setting on the app."
Keeps dropping shows before completion of series. (Sucks getting hooked on shows and waiting for the next season for it to NEVER come.) Already paying for multiple devices. I AM NOT PAYING EXTRA FOR MY KIDS PROFILE ANY MORE THAN I WAS WILLING TO PAY FOR ADS. (Ads are why I will never do HULU.) I will cancel my subscription first.
"Chromecast doesn't work half the time. Shows the Netflix logo on the tv, but phone never connects. Really frustrating when you have to try multiple times to connect with the Chromecast when you wyabt to watch something. fix it please"
"I love Netflix and have had it for a few years now. But, they suck on keeping up with content. They never add anything new until the last minute, and its all usually never anything good. Even the old movie that they add aren't good. They never keep up with any of the series. It's always a year or more behind actual TV and any other TV platform."
I have used all the OTT apps and must say Netflix is the worst OTT app out there in the market. Brightnesa is always set to zero while watching movies. I am not able to increase brightness. So does it mean that we should watch only in the night in absolute dark room. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!!!!
The app crashes a lot. It gives me a black screen while still playing sound when I accidentally turn off mobile screen. And I get 5.10 error a lot and it can't be unsolved without restarting the mobile phone 2-3 times per week. Please fix this
"I really love the app but for the past one month, I can't seem to watch anything. When I play a movie, no visual, only audio keeps playing and there seem to be no solution to it. I really need my Netflix back"
"Need more options.. No good horror movies and almost everything that looks good is in a different language, I find it irritating. I want to watch the movie not read it. Netflix is everyones favorite place for tv so its time to step it up eh?!"
You need a movie marathon option. Please. Be such a good feature that no other streaming service has yet. I'd like to be able to load up 3-5 movies for a marathon that play one after the other without having to flick through and search for the next one.
"It's good, but i can't change the color of the subtitles and sometimes i have a hard time reading it becuz it blends in with the white background. I am using the app, i already changed it on the website but it won't change on thw app"
"I've been a Netflix user and i love it! Unfortunately, lately whenever i watch it crashes in the middle of the movie. It keeps crashing over and over again. Please do fix it. Thank you"
Don't need suggestions. That irritates me. What I want is an app that works. It freezes every time I use it. It's not my internet connection and my Sky app never freezes. So stop the unnecessary features to concentrate on a reliable app please.
Ive downloaded this app because its lockdown and there. is not much to do. I was gonna. take the standard version but i cannot seem to create. an account without giving up my card details which iam simply not willing to do. Add better payment methods netflix .Youve just lost a potential customer
"It's a fair price to pay for the content available. Here is a list of things that I don't like: - No ability to rate a movie or show apart from like or dislike. - You can't see a rating for the movies or shows or read any reviews, so one has to search in other apps if a show is worth watching. - Too much garbage content. - Too much political propaganda embedded in the exclusive shows and documentaries. - Suggestion system usually makes no sense at all."
"I was watching a kdrama series and suddenly somekind if error cane , it was something proxy . And then l reopened the app , my whole profile is gone , my list is empty , the drama i was watching, i am unable to find it on the app . I am unable to find many rramas that l saved in my list . Why !!!!???"
"After the most recent update, when I go to watch a show it either sends a playback error or will load a black screen with the sound still playing. I've uninstalled and reinstalled many times and my wifi works amazing."
"Netflix app is laggy right now. At some point the screen just went freeze. I can't click anything. I thought it was connection issue, but when i watch Netflix in desktop, the connection turned out to be just fine."
"On TV it works great, but on my tablet it consantly says App not responding,this warning even comes up on the tablet even if i am not trying to use Netflix, evening though i have full internet connection and i pay for 4 devices to use Netflix, sort out the bugs, as at this rate your planned price increase wont be worth it at all."
"Normally a big fan but since the last update (4/30/19) it hasn't been working. Keep getting device failure, loading failure, can't switch profile, etc. Please fix whatever broke in the last update. Paying entirely way too much for this service to not work!"
"I would like to a option simillar to youtube where you can chose your video quality while watching the videos. Because the auto select quality often puts me at a lower quality. It doesn't detect correctly often. So, a option video quality settings would be great."
"It is very buggy im not sure what to do options disappear,search doesn't work, download tab also disappear with the download i restart my device and updated the app too but nothing it solves itself in few day but I'm praying for this i need it to go smoothly if not perfect this kind of problem also occurs in my tv but usually there it doesn't even let you login please fix these issues."
Why would someone take something and make it worse. What happened to the preview button? And why is there a share button? I hate even seeing a share button not just for the fact it's taking the space of the preview button but also share what. The sheer irrelevance of this button is mind numbing. I can't even think of something more useless then this button. I want too revert back to an older install of the app. Even if I can't have the preview button back can we get rid of the share button.
"The content is good. But if I want to find Hindi dubbed movies or series that option is not provided. It's very tedious task, I have to play the movie and look weather it has Hindi as an option."
It takes up a lot of space on my computer I recommend just using the website. Edit: It happens so many times where I will go to watch something and we share and account with my grandmother so she can use it to but we have the two screens which in my family it was fine but four screens cost a lot of money. But now being at home I have noticed I can't watch my shows since somebody is on so it would be nice if they lowered the price you would probably get more users that way.
"The app is great no question about it but there seems to be a download issue, at first I was on 2 device contract and it wouldn't let me download due to a download limit or too many devices. So I upgraded to 4 devices and I still have the issue, we only have 2 mobiles on the contract so I don't understand where the limit is, I want my moneys worth"
I miss the old days of dvds when Netflix had every movie imaginable... plus why are most of the previews just a single clip from the movie that doesn't give you any idea what the movie is about? And don't turn to the description for help. Most times it just tells you who is starting in it... So often I have to Google the movie to figure out what is about.
"Great app and movie selection, but there's one thing you might improve: warn users before you remove series they watch. It happened to me and my son again - in the middle of second seaaon we watch together for past few weeks it just disappears."
"when you start watching something, if you stop watching it for a while netflix will remove it from the thing that you're watching, it would be better if we started seeing something and it still in there or if we don't want to watch no longer it could have a button where we choose to stop watching it."
"Netflix could bring in a better selection of the Horror genre. Usually only cheesy, low budget movies that are very disappointing. Plus, so many foreign East indian movies. Im not rascist in the least, but why give us so many foreign movies? I know the American netflix version has a far better selection of movies in all genres. Why are we so different?"
"weird bug when tracking 10 seconds forward or backwards. the audio seems to get out of sync I'll reconsider the rating based on how quick you resolve this issue, its been going on for 4 months since the last update"
The ratings are purely for the reason that Netflix India does not support RuPay cards payment since almost all debit cards in India are RuPay now. Kindly also try for the subscription plan to be merged with the mobile service provider so it becomes more convenient. Kindly look into this. Thanks
"hi netflix, I used netflix for 2 months and realized that the shows are restricted according to region. The show which i was interested in were not available in India. I tried VPN but netflix refuses to use proxy. I am from India. So now i stopped the subscription. Please make note of it. If you allow the contents the. I will continue my subscription."
"Great streaming response, but app player is woefully outdated. Why does it not have better controls like a FFWD button or playback speed control? And why do we need to configure the subtitle size/format in a separate webpage interface?"
I love being able to watch Netflix on my phone. But I wish I can turn down the brightness because at night its to bright for my eyes with the lights off. If I could even get it down to the brightness of my screen that'd be awesome.
has any have problems with Netflix seems new update from my TV nothing is working and or showing. I have turned it off and restarted on my TV and everything nothing has changed. what it could be .it works on my phone but not on my smart TV or my bluray.. would like to watch but am not goin to pay if I can't watch anything
"When I try to rewind 10 seconds while watching a download, the app logs me out. This is incredibly frustrating. Especially when you are underground on the subway."
"All was well. But now, all this app does is crash after playing something for a minute. Literally a minute. I reinstalled the app after removing it, but still the same issue is arising. Please see to it"
"On the S20 Ultra. App causes my phone to restart randomly. No specific behaviour on the app makes it restart however whenever I am in the app, just launching or just exiting it, my phone will restart sometimes. It does still work well when it doesn't trigger however."
"Loved it,and Its very easy to use and there are hell lot of films and series.... And the worst thing i felt is, there is no UPI payment option. I'm suggesting you to include UPI payment, And if i go for the debit card option, Some of the Debit card is not working (Like - Rupay card). Plzz solve these problem.."
A well set out app but when are you going to use the 'ratings' I give to provide me with a 'Top picks' or 'We think you'll like'. I don't expect my top picks list to be populated with films I have already seen and rated. This shows lack of your interest in me!
Cast button does not appear. I updated the Netflix app in the app store. Updated Google home to most recent version. Restarted my phone. Performed a factory reset on Chromecast. But the cast button still isn't showing.. help.
"Netflix is good but if it could be more like the old Blockbuster or Hollywood video or whatever it was called, that would be worth five stars. I feel like Netflix and red box have destroyed a lot of peoples jobs and those memories of going to pick a movie out with the kids was awesome times that don't feel anything similar to sitting and scrolling through lame ass cable channels or standing in line at a 711 red box. Plus the selection seems like a lot but each person will find little to choose f"
"this app is amazing but i just hate that all the episodes are all out of order for like all the shows or most and also that they dont put all the seasons like for icarly, they only put three seasons (the third is like mixed in with the second) and theres like 4,5 seasons but overall this app is great to watch shows and movies."
"Something is seriously wrong with Netflix... Whenever i open the app it takes forever to load the home page... Its updated, the internet is good, every other app is working fine but Netflix can't stop loading the home page... Please resolve this issue asap"
All of the good movies have been removed! In place of them are netflix movies which are def. Not as good! They really should add back a lot of there movies. It is just the new versions of things......which is not as good as the originals we all know that!
"I like this app, and its ease of use. However, I find it frustrating that the picture-in-picture doesnt work. I tried restarting the app, restarting my phone, uninstalling and reinstalling to no avail."
"I have been with Netflix for years and this is just plain sad. It has my subtitles on everytime I watch anything, it knocks me out of the show or movie I'm watching. Netflix, you need to fix this. I've never had problems like these."
"It's a great app, but it takes off shows that were on their for like a year and keep shows that have been there for like 10 years. It doesn't have a lot of anime which is disappointing. It also charges quite a bit per year."
"Netflix is great and all but I'm rating it 3 stars because series that aren't netflix originals are never completed, for exampe nowhere boys, or lab rats, or my babysitters a vampire. That is very annoying. Please complete any series you start."
"I like this app, I've had it for years and I'm happy with it. However, the big problem is the lack of Romanian subtitles for movies and series. You have a good amount of subtitles but romanian ones are always added last or not at all. You should pay attention to this and rectify the problem."
"The app is really great and has a really good feature of Smart Download. But I have noticed that while watching downloaded episodes, the app crashes. Netflix, please fix this."
"If we fast forward the movie thrice or above in a single shot, then the sound and audio becomes out of sync. It will be fixed only of you close and open the app."
"What's with all the foreign language movies? If I set my preferences to English, I want to watch English movies. Is it because Netflix is cheapskate and these movies are cheap to show in other countries? Not such great content once you've watched the few blockbuster movies"
Picture in Picture mode should be resizable. Pop up window is too small. It too small that I'm unable to rewind 10 seconds back in pip mode. There should be fast forward feature too in pip mode.
Since the last update I've been unable to use the app. Whenever I open the app it gets stuck in the black screen with Netflix logo and after several seconds a message 'Can't reach Netflix...' appears.
"Hi, cant adjust the brightness level on my Huawei Nova 3i during playback. Ive used netflix before and definitely had a brightness adjuster on the left middle part of the screen. Now its set to very low dim, even though my phone brightness is high. The problem only is during playback please fix"
it's nice but any movie or anime that I want to watch are not there... Also it's a little boring because there are no comments. I really wanted you to do something. I want to be able to watch movies with my friend that lives abroad. I want to be able to chat with her and watch the movie in the same server for example if I skip a part it skips for her too. Please make this possible!!!!
"I like the app very much and the reason I have given it a 3 star instead of 4 or 5 is due payment methods. I don't like to subscribe it through card payments instead I'd love it if upi methods like phonepe, paytm, googlepay were available. So that's the I didn't subscribed it. Hope developers would do something for this and make the payment method convenient for us."
"I'm baffled by the fact that you do not get an option what languages are downloaded when you download an episode. I am Polish but prefer to watch foreign language films in English, so when I downloaded a couple shows originally in German and only got Polish and German subtitles it bummed me out."
"I am using the app and casting through a chromecast, it doesn't allow me to skip forward. Would really work better with a 10 second skip forward and backwards."
"Was better. But they increased the monthly price. As well as they keep taking away shows then bring part of it back later. And no idea when there might be more. There are some shows that they have taken away and put back numerous times. There are other shows that they only have a few seasons when there are numerous seasons of that show out there. If they are going to increase the price, like they already have, then why not make more shows more readily available with all the complete seasons."
Barely use it coz the movies I want to watch is not there mostly. I have to go buy it somewhere else and watch what Netflix gives me. With this big of a brand they should have the classics and more sought after movies rather than the movies that are just namesakes.
"I think I'm wasting my data on this stupid application , sometimes i think there are too many Ghosts in your application ü§£ü§£ü§£ so please kick them out bcoz of them the video pausing abruptly and only I'm able to hear the audio also sometimes the video cancelling automatically ü§¶ü§¶ i think you stupid developers are doing nothing..... Please fix this issue"
"latest update is not alloIng to scroll soN on the windows app, nor on android 7.1 o. the new pico projector i have. only thing that works is via menu . because the home page is frozen on a new proposed serie or movie that is on the whole screen. arrow down doesnt work on android for netflix ."
"when i exit the app after using it for some time, the status bar shifts below the notch, the notch remains hidden and I can't open the notification tray. I have to reboot the phone to fix it. Facing this problem in Android phone."
"Needs more flexibility when selecting video quality. Add the ability to choose 2k, 1080p, 720p and so on in the video player rather than a generic 'save data, or 'maximum data' in the settings."
"I love netflix at first, it ease my boredom & stress even its not free. But now i cant renew or update my payment, even my bank account had funds, before it deducts automatically, but now i dont know what happened. Its been a mont of updating updating payment. It just say there's a problem with my payment mode."
"On devices such as Xbox or PC it works fine, but on mobile I can't find some of the shows/movies in my list(they don't come up when I search them.) I was watching avatar on my Xbox, but when I went on my phone it wasn't there :/"
It just doesn't work with wifi. While using wifi it just keeps on loading and when I shift to mobile data everything is okay and it works fine. My wifi is very good and all the other apps work very fine on wifi.
"Although Netflix is a good app, I don't like that certain shows are for the USA only. I also don't the way Netflix's age restriction works as Brooklyn 99 has the same content (give a take) as modern family but B99 is a 15 while modern family is a U. But o er all except for the few pet peeves I love Netflix and is 100% worth it."
Netflix developers should really put a black background on the subtitles that appear so that all the text is easily visible against any scenes. It used to be there before. Nowadays it's just text in white colour in subtitles that is just not visible against many scenes
Most recent update had led to the pause/skip overlay to no longer be removed when tapping. Luckily there is a timeout so I can simply wait for it to disappear but I hope this gets fixed in a future update. Otherwise all is well
Lots of old stuff and foreign selection is too notch. New and interesting materials are few and far between. Programming needs to improve. Price too high for selection available. Just a meh app.
"What's up with Netflix nowadays? initially, I thought it was a problem with my PC but I've come to realize that every time I open Netflix, everything slows down. It takes a really long time for me to get anything done, including watch my favorite shows. can someone advise me on what's going on?"
Their programming is getting worse and worse. Why do you have a home if it's just going to land on somewhere else just call somewhere else home. Needs better settings. I don't know what's going on with Netflix but they've been going downhill when it comes to there user interface
I can't understand the only problem I have with this app is when you're watching this a movie it cuts off and goes back to the home screen it probably did it to me at least five six times the one day and I was so irritated I started watching Hulu.
The app keeps on freezing but playing in the background. Please fix it. I love Netflix but It is getting frustrating. Let me know what I need to do on my end:)
"They should add more newer movies in weekly basis & very large variety too, good app and the main one for me but still they can improve it, and why i should switch my location or use VPN to watch movies, its ridiculous. Keep it public and in any location, i think we are paying the same @ the end."
"The app and service itself is excellent. The only complaint I have is the selection. I get that owning rights is an issue sometimes, but at LEAST KEEP SOME OF THE OLD TITLES PLEASE!, Instead of removing them!"
An OK app needs a bigger selection and even more so if they are going to put the price up. A lot if old films and some seem to never leave the app they are always there.
It keeps on signing me out if I go back while playing a video. Its super annoying especially since it didn't recognize my username and password a bunch of times. I'll change this to 5 stars if they fix it but it's been going on for months
"Annoying Push Notifications even with app settings indicating notifications are disabled. That's an invasion of my space, folks. Separate msg sent to developers about same, but automated email response implies it's probably a waste of time."
"Recent updates ruined the resume option. Now most of the shows and movies starts from beginning whenever I take a pause. Please fix this, this is getting worse day by day."
"From 1* to 3*. I'll update it to 5*, once you'll add a better way to filter the movies / tv series (even the illegal sites have better filtering system) and as soon as you'll stop adding movies without translations. Why would you add a movie without translation? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Newest app update stopped me from being able to dim the shows enough. Too bright for my eyes at night on my phone! Loved the beta feature of just the sound. Perfect for falling asleep to. I want that back!
"The app is fairly good but annoyingly when serial episodes are released, they won't upload until much later in the day. The episode says it's available on dd/mm/yyyy but when you check in the morning or afternoon it isn't available, which is weird because the episodes are from an American network originally where they were available to watch the day before? I don't understand why I have to wait and I think it's ridiculous considering the money I pay."
"Works fine besides downloads, they never work anymore for some reason even after uninstalling and reinstalling Netflix. I even tried different wifi locations just doesn't seem to work anymore..."
"Crappy selection of movies/shows for Canadian users but it's cheap enough to be worth it if you like to watch the same things over and over again like I do. I wish I could turn off the, ""Are you still watching?"" feature cause its annoying when I'm having a binge day."
For some reason the Netflix PWA only shows on the small Pixelbook screen and doesn't allow me to drag it over to the large monitor connnected to the pixelbook. The Disney+ PWA allows me to do that no probs. Not good...
"Everything is limited or boring to watch, there is nothing interesting! There are missing seasons for some tv series, the things I want to watch on this app are only available in other countries!! Like I can't watch for example.. Big bang theory or missing parts of movies.."
"Hate how my list disappears sometimes. Sometimes the movies don't load and i have to choose it and reopen it ... but the my list dissappearing is a real pain, and how yuppie movies get thrown into your list at random, wish they stayed there in the order i put them in, its dumb"
"My last account I had with Netflix was hacked a few days after I made a large payment via gift card. The person that hacked my account also changed the language on it. So I was not able to direct myself to change the password. I spoke to a lady in customer service, she told me that it was my fault that my account was stolen. I should have used stronger privacy methods. She could not help me at all. I have a new account now and I'm paranoid to pay more than month at a time. Only bad thing for me."
"At first it worked great, now all of a sudden it won't load and when I try to view on the web site, all it does is it's request to get the free app. But the app won't open. All I get is the Netflix symbol. This sums."
hi I watch Netflix on my phone. it was working perfectly. now the video freezes but the sound keeps playing. It also makes a vibration sound every few seconds like I have a notification but nothing there. any suggestions?
"Netflix is great but, they are getting to a point where they are only adding originals that no one wants to watch. I mean, it has a lot of great originals. I loved Fuller House and Mr. Iglesias. It also feels like they remove TONS every couple of days. Overall, pretty decent."
"Ever since I downloaded the app, it's been difficult to watch complete movie. When I play a movie, downloaded or not, it's just a blank screen, with audio. I am only lucky sometimes to be able to watch movies."
Can someone please help me. Why is it that when I download a series to watch on the go I press ti watch it and it pops up with. There is a problem trying to play this video. Please try again. (2.119) and none of my videos play at all unless I download them again and then it pops up with. Downloaded to many times this year. Sorry. It's so frustrating what can I do to stop it ?
"I really don't know what's wrong with the app but it needs to be fixed at the earliest, it is almost killing the experience. What is it with the sound? Why do I not hear anything the moment I plug in earphones or I connect it to the bluetooth speaker? Please fix it!"
Im traveling in the US and netflix has trouble knowing where I am(they think im still in europe) they send me error messages and it is really annoying. I keep installing and uninstalling my app this seems to help but it happens all the time.
"When loading the app on Lenovo tablet the show tiles are just bank not loading any image or description, when scrolling across it takes ages to load. I have reinstalled to no avail the app is just struggling and out of focus for tablet viewing. Mobile app presenting the same issues."
"The Netflix app gets the job done, my only issue with it is that even if you have the 4 screen plan with UHD streaming the app will only let me stream content at 720p HDR, which is a disappointment and a bit of a waste."
My only complaint is that it offers very less films and shows . Specially the old and the recent hits and Blockbusters are not offered to the viewerd. The subscription fee that we are paying is not worth it. Very disappointed from NETFLIX.
Really frustrated it locked me out of account same night we just resubscribed and says too many log in attempts it kept saying incorrect password. I reset pw 3 times! I used the password to log into the website so what's the problem?! Can't find a way to actually chat with or call anyone. If reinstalling doesn't work I'm going to demand refund.
I took over my daughter's account while she was gone awhile and I never watch TV much anymore so I was going to shut account up for a while until she come back stateside...welll they turned it off finally however after midnight my card was charged anyway for the month yet I called and kept my cool they did return a payment however they still that night took out the payment again they refunded and charged me again this month. I can not imagine what happens when you use the pause option. my $ plz
"love it !! although they should release some old series eg. Fringe, Under The Dome, Warehouse 13, Librarians etc. üòäother than that , Netflix is perfect for binge watching. ALSO , the past few days it shows that Netflix has a problem Everytime I want to watch it on my phone"
"Everytime I wanted to continue my watching after close the app, the movies will froze, sometimes just show me a black screen with sound on it. And I need to restart my device to continue watching again."
I don't know what you broke but every time you release an update and I have to download the update it I can seem to access my downloads so it means I have to spend hours to download everything again. Just BTW it been happening for the past 9 updates and counting.
"It is really good. However, since a few days it has stopped working. Whenever I on the app it gets stuck on the page saying Netflix. So please fix this issue. As otherwise the app is 5 star worthy."
"The app isn't opening on Redmi note 7 pro. It's such a hassle to have an account but the app isn't opening. It's just showing Netflix and nothing after it . Please fix it ASAP, I've uninstalled and then reinstalled the App but again it's not working ."
I've been using Netflix for years but every single time I'm about to finish a show they take them off like star crossed or lost girl. This app would be a whole lot better if shows would stop being took off.
"Becoming more buggy with each update. Sometimes it doesn't load, gets stuck at startup and the solution? Restart the entire phone. Not a practical solution esp if i have other options to watch content."
"It's a good ap but, it downloads movies and TV shows with out me even knowing! Some of the tv shows and movies that it downloads by itself are things I've never even seen or watched. In the future, please fix that!"
"It's great to watch series here in netflix especially korean series but i have some problem here i encounter first is when we watch korean series after 10 episode is it okay but after next episode it did not play wer shock because of what happen when we search it, it said that the series si not available nexttime netflix inform your viewers if that series will not be availble in what date and time so we will not waste are time to watch in the first place it make me sad to happen like that."
"Good overall but updates are too frequent, would prefer major releases. Also cannot watch videos whilst the I'm on hold to call centres. Also annoying I cannot use pop up windows to message or multi task."
"On my tablet, every time I search for movie's, the ones I search for rarely ever come up but when I search for another one a few weeks later, it just appears out of thin air. It works properly on a TV though"
"This is a very good app that let's you whatch whatever you like and you can add parental control, however your age rating is so overrated my parents had the no 15s or over then you need a password and I was ok, but then my favourite show with a new series Brooklyn 99 got changed to 15 and now I cant find out what happens in the episode I'm on! Other than the age rating it's a good app. Also I dont know what happened to the way u used to be able to leave the app and it still play it in the corner"
"I like netflix but there is a TON of stuff that I would never watch, so many bad movies noone has heard of. I dont mind subtitles but sone are very badly dubbed and sentances dont make sense. I'm paying more than last year but not seeing changes yet."
"If Netflix had more Turkish TV shows it would blow up even more, shows like kirgin cikler,the black rose,that you can watch the story actually evolve with life related twists and not just the 10 episodes life spand.Plus if you could do the small screen while you are on the app. Needs more comedy and less light porn.The video quality is grate in every movie but the movies lack at substentence.Most of them are very predictable and cringe worthy but the are some greats in just have to search for."
Searching for something to watch displays the same thing over n over. Hard to find a good flick until netflix recommends it to u. Takes forever for good recommendations to appear. Would like to see browse by genre feature on this.
"I enjoyed Netflix. No doubt content is very good! However, I wanted to delete my account before the specified date but account didn't open after many attempts repetedly for three days. Later I uninstalled my account but affected the payemt. Not goodü§ôüèª"
"Movie choices are great and there's a wide variety. However, the app itself is quite buggy. In addition, the price for Netflix is quite high. Overall, decent."
The application hangs when there is an incoming call. You need to exit the existing screen and open it again for the screen to start working again. Also this is happening off late so not sure of any update has affected this.
Way too much buffering takes way too long even with the fastest internet that I have maybe at about 100% it's a 40% so it's okay I guess Hulu and Hulu Plus and Disney plus tops Netflix no questions asked y'all need to up your game Netflix and you need to add extras just like Hulu and Disney have where you can stream live TV and get new episodes for the stuff you have on there movies and shows
I have used Netflix for years and I love it. Recently the new update is terrible. I can not keep the subtitles off and it keeps kicking me out of what I'm watching. This needs to be fixed immediately.
Like the options but hate that it's so slow to update the show seasons. Don't know why the service is upping the price when the latest movies are not on here. I dont care about 4kHD or whatever. Cant I get the option of if I want that or not? Kinda unfair to make me pay for 4kHD when I dont have a 4K TV. Nor do I intend to get one.
It's indeed good but movies aren't great to be precise. I don't know the message will be seen by them or not but please do upgrade the movies pasting process. People aren't happy enough by the movie categories. Do upload new movies as well.
I have an android and i'm disappointed because about 2 weeks ago i was able to turn the video off and just listen to my shows while i was at work but the option just disappered. Now my battery drains soo fast. Bring that option back please.
"Netflix is good and all, but my WiFi is slow so on occ it would take 5-10 mins just for the episode to load. Normally I don't mind but they need to fix it so WiFi speed should not matter."
"Now! This time its good that Netflix is having some of my demanded shows üòä but still the problem is with audio,there is no option of English audio while watching Naruto shiphuaden ‚òπÔ∏è. Please see to that problem ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Thank you!"
There is a brightness glitch in the app. Everytime when the brightness is adjusted the glitch happens and the brightness cannot be adjusted. To solve this the app has to be uninstalled and reinstalled again and again.Even after the update the glitch exsists. Please fix thisüôè
Though netflix is enough good but there always a problem in playing download video.. Always have to restart and then download disappeared and to download even our data also get finished. That the main problem... Pretty good üëçüôè
Netflix is losing a lot of the shows that got me to buy a subscription in the first place and alot of its original series and movies used to replace thrm are bad but overall it is still great.
"Good Originals However, it's particularly frustrating to have to constantly click a button every two or three episodes in order to keep it playing. Hulu+ lets you play a show ALL NIGHT LONG."
"I went to put the app on my phone even after logging out of every other place with netflix, my username and oassword is correct, yet it won't let me sign in! I have deleted and downloaded this app many times. I even changed the password and its still not working!"
Dual subtitle should be an option. I watch netflix for language learning. I hope you can make an update dual subtitle since there is english and spanish depending on the movie. Will update rating once this happens
"It would be nice to have a ""leaving soon"" section with all the movies & shows together that are leaving in a month that way you don't miss something that you wanted to watch. I know that it says it when you go into the show but with so many options a lot of times you may miss something or you may forgot about it until it was too late."
"I use netflix on every device but there's one flaw. I cant finish the movie I'm watching because towards the end, I am forced into a trailer of another movie. I'll happily give 5 stars if there's a troubleshoot or when it is fixed."
I have notifications TURNED OFF. So why the hell are you sending me notifications?! I don't wish to hear about any upcoming movies about to be added. I can find that out by viewing the app itself. Please fix this. I don't want notifications.
"I love it for binging movies or shows, especially in quarintine, but ever since i updated it, it logged me out and i put in the correct password, doesnt work. I reset the password and it still doesnt work."
"its supposed to be a good app, but lately it keeps crashing, even on the smart tv app. and i cant even cast what im watching onto the tv. please fix this. its really a good app w good movies/series. i just happen to keep having this problem lately."
"Older Versions could turn off Capacitive Buttons backlight, wish the current version could. This phone works just fine still, 2013 Droid Turbo, it's got another year in it before the battery life prompts an upgrade."
"I love Netflix, it's a great app, but for some reason every time in the middle of my episodes or movies it starts to jump frames, making the show/movie seem buggy, but the audio works as normal."
"Hello dear Netflix developers. The application is fine actually but I'm here to tell you about global injustice. I pay full price for Netflix and I can pay more but why are there no some movies available in my region??? Excuse me, what did my country wrong so I can't watch Molly's Game or Steve Jobs? These movies are not banned in my country but banned in Netflix. I can pay more but let me watch all movies on Netflix. Thank you"
"It was a far superior service. 2020 has taken its toll, so that's why it loses a star. Too many old programmes or ones you can watch elsewhere for free, and not many new or new ish films or programmes being added. Add proper filters for year etc. I realise that most filming was haulted but its doesn't stop the release of some new content already filmed that a billion pound plus company could afford. Tag new to Netflix, not new when it's filmed in 1995 or something."
Y'all need to bring back Julie and the Phantoms. There are so many people that want to see more of it. Their story isn't over. Also the playback speed function is awesome but y'all need to find out how to put it on the TV version.
"It takes to long for shows to get added to Netflix, like last month they added a movie from 2013, please speed it up, otherwise works fine, i do have some bad lags every now and then but thats about it."
"it's a good app but like with some shows like animes that have recently popped up it's not available in my country even though it shows me as a recommendation, and we pay for this app so i don't know why we can't watch it. I don't know if it's because of the copyright law but i still wanna watch anime with no ads :("
"Annoyed to this error: Could not reach netflix service -1001. I can login using browser. I can browse movies and series. When i click play, i will be redirected to the app. Then error appears. I cant watch for what i am paying for ü§îü§îü§î"
"The subtitle appearance won't change no matter how much i change it, tried clearing cache and all and it's still the same, I can't read the subtitle at all with the current settings because it's white and with white highlight."
"I have been using this app for a long time and just now updated the latest version. The ""skip intro"" and ""skip recap"" feature is not working. please take a look into it."
"I've always been watching movies and my favorite series in Netflix but I don't really know what just happened if it's just me or sumn, my screen turns black whenever I want to play a video. Please fix this."
"Love Netflix, use it on all my devices. Lately on my phone it's giving me errors when trying to download within the app... which is the biggest perk of the mobile app. please fix and rating will be increased."
"Netflix was great in the 10's, but has not aged well. Fun content like Disney's library, Rick & Morty and children's classics like Barbapa, Miffy, etc... disappeared. Instead came conformistic Netflix originals that make you cringe. I am totally fine with emancipation of groups, but if I pay for entertainment I want to be entertained and not witness some awkward culture struggle of a (for me) far away country, the USA."
"App is suddenly forcing notifications and recommendations even though it is turned off. If this doesn't quite, I'll delete and not use anymore. I don't like commercials being rammed down my throat."
"Ever since the new update it's impossible to watch anything that I've downloaded it's either it won't stop loading or it'll be error(5-7) which says I have to restart my device that clearly doesn't do anything. 3 stars , but its good if you use wifi"
"Marketing is definitely it's main attraction as you are forced to watch what they offer, most of the movies and even series are not included. Acclaimed movies and series are what I'm paying for...... I might as well move to a free app which has all the movies and series üôÑ"
"Nice movies and picture quality, but you can do better with the mobile app. Its hard to connect keeps loading I have to try over and over to connect yet the 'poor Showmax' allows me in with one click."
"The app works great all shows are nice, but I am a weeb and the Anime here hasn't been updating lately, for example Haikyuu!! Netflix only has sessions 1 and 2, although there are 3 sessions, so Netflix please update your Anime. Thank You"
"Great selection of movies and videos, but I just hope there is an option for 4K download. It only downloads at 720p which is very low quality and unwatchable in 4k uhd screens."
"Love Netflix ,I love it I won't lie it is easy to use and many genres to come by but when I download episodes and try watching it on a trip or by a place with no network the movie begins lagging on random parts of the movie hope you can fix this."
Great app except for the last update. The cast button has disappeared? That needs to be fixed asap. Put it back in the top corner where it actually makes sense. Other than that its good
"This app is good at content audio and video quality. But, comes to indian content it is very much lag in updating. For a month 1or 2 Bollywood movies and south language movies like telugu 1 or nil. Most of video content is either English or other non Indian languages."
"Why can't I dismiss the player functions all of a sudden? Before, I used to be able to tap the screen to bring up the UI while watching a video and then tap again in an empty space to dismiss it but now I have to wait for it to go away? Who the heck thought that was a good idea? Is there a way to disable this?"
Everything is working fine except the lag that occurrs while playing a stream on mobile devices. It resolves when you tap on the screen and occurrs again in a few seconds sometimes in a few minutes. Please fix this issue.
"Your latest update has screwed everything. It keeps telling me I have no internet connection but I have no problem writing this review. It also doesn't know where I'm up to in a show anymore, it'll take me back to the start. Very frustrating considering you've increased subscription price"
Basic stuff. A lot of their catlogue vanishes ovee time. They ahouldnt take the contract if they cant afford to keep it permanently. Their originals are okay. I liked Altered Carbon. Why does this review box not have autocorrect emabled (misspelling to prove point).
"I wish there was more ways to save the movie to watch and see new instead of it showing you everything you watched already in your list for movies. I've tried adding them to my list doesn't help, they still show up. I need new movies to watch this is why I left Netflix before. I don't want to rewatch movies over and over and over."
"There are some playback problems especially after answering & disconnecting the call, it starts playing automatically in background. Even if we are not on Netflix app."
You can't find the new ones like The nightmare before Christmas and when it comes to happy ending it just finish off like that I don't like the movies that much a happy ending and then you don't get the rest and what I always watch something always goes wrong not the end they fix it and it goes all right what is wrong with that I hate it so that's why I give it three or four stars
"I like to ask why all my download have been going into audio and subtitles. My subscription last month was total waste, because I could not watch a single movie. Another month subscription is going already with no ability to watch. Kindly suggest way out."
The app is better than the content. I think the reason why Netflix doesn't provide any decent search/sort/filter capability is because then subscribers would see just how little decent content there is.
It just stopped working and now I see a black screen when I click the app. Also Netflix keeps cancelling shows left and right and for what?? They isn't anything good to watch anymore honestly not worth the money anymore.
"Your smart download feature is awesome that it downloads the next episodes and deletes the watched episodes regardless of which device you watch the episode in. But the problem is, it's not consistent."
"As someone who's hard of hearing and needs the subtitles, I get comedy out of this when not intended because the cc is inaccurate at times, but overall an okay streaming service. They keep getting rid of good shows though."
Great when nothing to watch content getting limited with more foreign language films not supporting english when being added to a prodominantly english speaking country some even cater multiple languages all except English not on when we pay for it Its just some of the movies/shows look like they could be a great watch until start them goto change it to english se like 5 other language options but no english
Decent. Most of the decent shows and movies have been taken off in most countries and it's better to just use a local streaming service with a bigger catalogue of shows and movies. However the Netflix originals are pretty goodüëç
Volume Problems - the volume of the shows and movies keeps getting quieter and quieter. I have to watch everything on Netflix at 14 and higher. I watch all other platforms between 5 - 8.
It gives black screen after sometime of binging it does not support video but the audio works fine it gives black screen and the audio will still be running after so i would remove it from recent and again open it but it gives green screen after that so i stopped using it....
"The shows take a LONG time to come out with a new season, honestly they should just put shows in when they have a few seasons. Also I think that if a show has one or two seasons and was made in like 2018 and hasn't come out with any more the they should take the shows off of Netflix. Other than that its amazing."
"Hi, its been good experience using Netflix, but recently i have encountered a issue, my mobile get hangs and swithed off when i try to play downloaded videos, this issue doesn't occur all time. Only two times. Please look into it."
"Since the 20th Feb 2023 update, shows have started skipping like scratched DVDs. It's very retro, but not something that I think was planned! Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but it hasn't helped."
Yea not bad. Syncs with my Chromecast. The only problem I see is that you don't have controls for the video. Would love to see a feature where you can stream to VLC or something.
The app is great but recently it is showing that I'm connected to VPN or proxy even though my internet settings are proper... I don't know why this keeps happening. It would be great if they fix it.
"Amazing app worth 5 stars, yet I ranked it with 3 stars as there are not enough tv shows and movies in the UAE. Tv series like big bang theory, two and a half men, and even fresh prince of bel-air are not there. Movies like fast and furious (some parts) and hangover (part 1 & 2) are not there either. Please complete the list as I subscribed almost 4 months ago and I'm almost done with the good stuff in UAE's netflix list. Please add ""the mentalist"" to the list!"
While watching video in full screen the control buttons and subtitles are way too bright and hurts the eyes. A less bright colour will be soothing to eyes. Other thab that the app is really great.
keeps cutting off and doesn't let me watch something's as it keeps loading. this app is truly as interesting as watching paint dry but then you get better resolution from that.
"I really like the app except how it plays automatically after unlocking the device. So if I pause a show, lock my phone and then unlock my phone, the app will resume playing the show. I consider this an anti-feature."
"been watching movies up here for over a year, then i decided to update it and got regrets because the updated version kinda slowed down the series ( as in ) sometimes it stops itself, it skips on its own ..... Please fix this ! TY"
Netflix is a great app but recently having problems with it. Keeps coming up with the error can't reach Netflix service. I've rebooted device several times but still same issue.
"While switching qualities, the video player glitches way too much. This happens specially on a title which has hdr support. Fast forwarding shows black screen as well. How things turn out to be like this for this amazing platform?"
"Everything is fine but there's a bug that whenever I lock my phone while using netflix, it will automatically resume playing even if I didn't touch my phone. Really annoying, hope this gets fixed soon"
Battery use is extreme for an app that runs in the background on startup without actually being used. It shouldn't use any resources at all until I'm actually using the app to browse and play content.
The app is sleek and user friendly. However I have a suggestion: it would be a lot better if the video player had more advanced options such as an equalizer and speed controls.
"totally confused by this review. I have no recollection of loading a review, but it wouldn't be 5 stars if I did. App and service are both OK but not much better than that. I was part way through a movie that was dropped at the end of the month and I never got a chance to finish it."
"Since I update the app some weeks ago, if i want to watch any movie on it, i would have to reboot my phone, or else it won't play, it will just be loading... And even if I reboot my phone and didn't use instantly, i would still have to reboot again, anytime i want to watch my saved movies..."
"Lately the app won't even load. I've been using it for years just fine, but now it tells me that there's and error when I attempt to open it. I've tried deleting and redownloading it, but it still won't load the home screen. Please fix."
I am starting watching all the movies and tv shows on my tv love it . But somehow when I started watch it on my phone it goes black screen and I can't see but only I can see the subtitles.
"The app is working fine, but the content sucks. Some of the series doesnt even have complete seasons and a lot of movies aren't available. Hopefully Netflix can improve, content-wise"
Audio is great but picture freezes for couple seconds then resumes play. But then the audio doesn't match the picture as far as people talking. Please fix this problem.
"I am a regular NETFLIX user , but every month I face problem during payment . When I enter my card details it automatically resets to blank after entering security number,even same thing happens when I click verify my card. I have to repeat it for 5 to 6 times in a hope that it will work this time But this it lead to temporarily blocking my card . Fix it NETFLIX"
"I like the concept of it with all the different movies, but I don't like it that it costs money, and most of the movies don't even exist on the Netflix platform, if it'd be free and with more movies would it be the most popular and best rated streaming platform in existence"
"Frequently getting a message that says ""there is an problem in playing the video. Please try again. (5.8)"" ever since i re-downloaded the app less than a mth back. Now i have to restart the app a few times before i can watch an episode"
"The app is I'd say the best amongst the best but recently whenever I try to open the app just after the payment , it'll just end up back at the phone screen and I really don't get it , I'll appreciate it very much if you'd like to look upon this problem and if it doesn't work I'd like to get my refund as I've haven't used my acc since I've payed just now."
I have been enjoying it for awhile till today that I couldn't sign in to my account on my phone and laptop. I tried reaching out to customer service to no avail. I am just trying to uninstall the app and reinstall again to see if it would work. Signing in to my account with the right password and email has been a difficult experience today. Each time I try to change password it say the link is correct and I should request for another and that's been my issue through out today.
"The app seems to have crashed. I can't log into my account. The videos were taking too long to play so I tried logout- login activity, and now I am logged out. Despite having a valid and paid membership. Kindly look into the matter."
I can't watch downloaded shows when I downloaded an episode and try to play it then I get an error that this video cannot be played please try again. I have installed and reinstalled th app several times. I have also checked all the permissions still I get the same problem.
"It keeps having problem when you try to watch another show. Limited movies, mostly netflix productions. Interface is clumsy. Need to scroll by pictures, not by word list, which is slow."
i really really love nexflix and it's quality but... somtimes it just stops like it still showing the screen and everything but it just stops and it's not loading or anything and it has the unpause button on so if i was to pause it it stay like that like it's not unpausing or anything just like that i don't why but it is VERY ANNOYING
"Buenas noches, Lately its been very noticeable, with the vast and exciting diversity of audio and subtitles, in the @ud!@, whrn played in a different language from the original the translation is perfect, yet when the background special effects and sounds are ‚Ç©@y to different than decivels from the trans~lation, and is not fade it is just on top, and that is C#3@p0, you could charge for the tranlations yet quality of translations showing the crew, and 50. Cent for trans~lation p3rw‚Ç¨ek, 0r N0t?"
"Netflix netflix netflix , you guys are making a lot of money because you have a lot of costumers like us and you have to take care of your costumers you know, well i buy the subcription because i hear that you guys have the new movies , shows and the best series but i desagree , you only show one little piece of the series then I have to go youtube and try to find the rest,so i don't know why we still paying rigth! If youtube have everything you have for free,we're 50% happy but my kids like it"
For some strange reason I cannot get a Full Screen Vision of the movies on my phone. It is very dark and unable to see. I can only get a small screen vision. Is there a readon why all of a sudden this is happening.
I hate the in app brightness control. It is not bright enough when shows are dark. I did not have a problem until this feature showed up. Absolutely annoying. Please remove or make it optional.
Why is that the most of the movies is in English language. Request you to please make sure that if you are giving the services in India then there should be the Hindi translation on all the English movies. The app is good but giving 3 stars as the most of the movies are not translated in Hindi language.....Kindly translate all the English movies in Hindi so that people who don't understand English they can also enjoy the Netflix....
"Hello.. everything is good except that I am getting the below error. And the error stays on. I need to uninstall and reinstall the app. Error: ""Sorry we could not reach the Netflix service. Please try again later ( -1023)"""
Casting to Roku does not always work. I have to go into the Roku Netflix channel to open it using my Roku remote. Other than that this is a very good app.
Way to many bad movies now that are just plain stupid! Plus you need to watch some of whatever movie as see if it is good or bad.I like the old rating  system with the 5 stars like here instead of that dumb thumbs up and down system like they have now. To many freaking thumbs down makes me use my middle finger a lot! Before with the 5 star rating I gave Netflix a 5 star because I loved it!!!
"App showing error messages when trying to cast certain shows, making it essentially unusable since that's the only thing I use this app for. Since it's only on certain shows it's quite clear this is a Netflix side issue."
It keeps getting me log out after some days and the downloads delete automatically even the smart download option is off I have premium account and selected high quality but the download quality is still low dont know whats the issue plz fix this issue In playback option i have selected max data but it streams in low quality ... Plz fix this quality issue its so teasing
There are some movies and series that are not on Netflix and it is not fair because we subscribe on Netflix to watch whatever we want. So what is the use of the subscription if we can't watch what we want. I beg you look into this matter.
"It's bs when, someone else, you've allowed to go onto your account, to have Netflix on there phone, and your app is on Netflix.. on smart TV, That has apps, capible to get netflix, netflix account from cable company/provider, uses different password for every device, them I get logged out mine. On tv. Can sign into now freaking password.. bs Fu netflix"
"Whenever I try to watch something on my phone, the contrast drops to zero and stays dark no matter where the dial is. Not much good to have on my phone if I can't see the picture."
"I miss the feature where you can keep watching a series even after 3 episodes and not be interrupted by the ""are you still watching?"". It helped me fall asleep. Please offer an option for this at least."
I think you guys need to fix the subtitles syncing. The subtitles will always be either way faster than the actual dialogue or slower. Please fix this asap. It was annoying when i was watching non english movies or series.
"Love the shows on it but I have one major problem, when I try to watch on my phone, the video freezes but the audio continues to play. Apart from that it's great! üòÖ"
"Hey Netflix team. From the past few days, Netflix shows that I am using a VPN or Proxy on my mobile to watch movies. I am not at all doing that and using my wifi. The videos also don't load properly. Please fix this otherwise I'll have to switch options."
"I love my Netflix.....HOWEVER, I have been waiting for my payment to go through for over a week and it hasn't been taken. The money is there, I have checked for issues with my card, have done updates and checked my payment method in Google Play...still nothing. I cant watch a thing until you take my payment! Please fix this!"
"Inefficient customer care. I have had a chat with customer care to resolve my technical problem related to payment and restart membership. But they did not resolve my problem and asked me to contact my banks (because I used more than one card to resolve it) to resolve it and ended the chat without waiting for my answer. However, I resolved the problem myself and restarted my membership without the help of careless, worthless customer care."
"If they reduced the payment amount per month, it would be good and affordable. As Indian's (mostly parents) are into television, they will be paying for the television recharge, then monthly Wi-Fi payment and to pay for Netflix whose mostly payment is a bit on high rate isn't everyone's cup of tea. So, if the monthly payment is reduced then people may ready to afford it."
"Nice but could be better. it takes FOREVER to load. Also, there should be an option of removing shows in the ""continue watching"" because i commonly loose interest in the shows, and i want to remove them."
Watching Little Things Season 3 and Netflix forcefully shows Hindi subtitles ruining the experience. The show has 70% dialogues in English and I understand English very well. There must be an option to turn off subtitles for Hindi shows as they are never in pure Hindi and these subtitles ruin the experience.
"It would be much better if the functionalities on Android phone are exactly the same as on iPhone (e.g. Skip intro button, Next/Previous episode button during playback). Please consider."
"The subtitles are out of sync and lag behind. It makes watching a lot harder. I don't know how to fix it but I've uninstalled the app, restarted my phone, and nothing has worked."
"Can't select playback quality on mobile phone. Also, selection menu needs to be intuitive. Issues with Android 11 have started. Where mobile needs to be restarted to start watching. Annoying"
"Netflix is glitchy, loading, loading, loading! I know its not my internet because when Netfix acts up, I have no problem watching Disney +, Hulu, or Amazon. I hope they fix it because their programming is good."
"Things I'd like Netflix to change: Movies and tv shows leaving the platform too frequently, many low budget tv shows with poor quality (e.g plot, acting), the price of (at least) the basic plan being too high, and not valuing user opinion enough."
"The brightness bar is not properly aligned when used, it shifts slightly downwards when pressed resulting in higher brightness than intended. I would also like for this feature to be optional, since it overrides my device brightness control while using the app."
Netflix is a 79% good app to watch shows on.They should put more movies and series and they should put all movies in all continents and islands so everyone can watch there are wayy better apps that this and they charge you $0 so I basically can watch movies for free
It works fine and all but Netflix really pushing it with these price increases. Every other streaming service is no more than $10 a month and they're out here charging $21. All the others have more on them too!
"Was gonna put 4 stars but the new UI is so bad, I can barely even find the continue watching section, the new UI just makes it so that finding a show to watch takes 3x longer than the old UI, the swiping up and down is bad, have an option to change back please."
"I would have given 4* or 5*s but I have run into too many shows that the ending is not on Netflix; Naruto Shippuden, One Punch Man, One Piece (so far only up to alabasta ark), ect... i give a little grace to One Piece because of its sheer volume of episodes but there are so many more and some aren't even anime great app but sometimes dissapoints, but most of the time hits the nail on the head"
"Inam constantly having to uninstall this app from my tablet, and re-install because it says there is some kind of play back problem. Although I enjoy the shows, I just wish that I didn't have to always uninstall all of the time."
This app has good quality but the thing I hate most is that it doesn't have the latest shows. The app does have shows that are interesting and i am happy about that. Furthermore Netflix is a great app but needs more latest shows
"The algorithm 'recommends' shows for you to watch but you dont get shown all the other shows on netflix unless you go searching for them. Basically, it trys to tell you what you should want to watch"
"The app was working fine for a very long time and suddenly started malfunctioning on my phone, I've deleted and re-installed it multiple times but it works for a few hours then start going on a fritz again, and won't open"
"I really love this apps but recently i got problem when i try to log in back to my account. At first, i thought that my phone was the problem why i can't logging back. I try for another phone and it still the same. So my conclusion is there's nothin wrong with my phone instead the problem is at the apps. I hope you can fix this ASAP."
Great service but app keeps deciding not to start up completely from time to time and I get shown an error. It will then take hours or even a day until it decides to work again. Netflix you need to sort this out.
I don't like it when Netflix just cancels TV shows without notice. I feel that they need to put at least two weeks notice before they cancel a show. To me that shows that they care about the customer thanks. please do something about this
It's a really cool app but am rating three stars because I still find faults in it. I like the subtitles most specially for foreign movies. But the pictures don't always show.
"Heavy and sluggish, causes issues with streaming, very poor automatically generated subtitle, postponed episode delivery, hard to navigate, lacking content movie wise. It has good features but the issues outweigh them."
"Hi.. looks like a bug(video starts playing on background)(android phone, netflix updated as of oct 23rd 2019) 1.play a video on netflix, pause it. 2. Switch windows, open twitter, play a video on twitter. 3. When twitter is playing, Netflix video also start s to play on background itself."
"This was good and all, but what i hate the most is that the media library for the Philippines are so damn low. I feel like the subscription fee we've been paying for is not worth it. There are lot of series and movies that are not available here. I searched on google all the movies that i am trying to watch on this app. And I found out that they are available on other countries."
The aps is good. But im from indonesia and i cant watch netflix because is blocked by indihome. Its very dissapointing. I only can watch using my phone (using data) n its really annoying. Do u hav any other solution? I still on free trial. N i haven't decided to subscribe or not.
ever since the update(4/5/19) the casting is unresponsive. app does not work to pause/play the show. have to pull my notifications bar down and play/pause from there. cannot change episodes.
"There in no leg during Watching Netflix but when I download offline movies & Series in Netflix app. They don't give us a option that we want to download 1080p Quality Or 720p it's download automatically based on Internet Speed i want manual option... Like 480p, 720p, 1080p, 1440p ... So i can enjoy movies with hight quality available..... So @Netflix .. Please give us the manually Video quality Option with Bitrate...."
"It's a very good platform and affordable although if you are looking for Animation (Japanese) do not bother, I mean they are still on Season one of One Punch man. I wish they'd upload more or prioritize Animation a bit more."
"I have always had a positive experience with Netflix except for now. I can't open the app, I have uninstalled and then reinstalled it and it's still no go. This started after the latest update. Please could someone help me."
No matter what I do the subtitles/captions keep popping back up on every show or movie I watch and it's honestly really annoying having to click the dialog icon ever time you watch something. Sorry I don't like captions please fix this
"I would love if the app had an option to change the appearance of the subtitles on the app. I know you can go to the web and change it but it only changes it for PC anyway, it doesn't change it for android."
"I'm a user for almost 2 years now, but just now the app would just crash when I just opened it. I tried updating and also deleting then downloading it again but nothing works.. can someone help me with this? I really love watching movies and kdramas in here so its such a shame I can't open it anymore."
"Good app, but the new ""play something"" feature is annoying in it's size and location, and needs to be moved to a more discrete location, or give us the option to disable it (useless for me anyway)."
"It's really nice and good app for movies but after subscription you still have to use your mobile data for streaming or downloading, while you can still use the same amount of data to download the same movie elsewhere without any subscription. This pisses me off"
"New update makes subtitles come on automatically & app closes show and goes to main menu on its own every 15 minutes or so. Each time, it resets & must turn subtitles back off. Please fix."
Could have been a perfect rating for me aside from the irritating and disappointing fact that there's a download limit for TV series. That sucks big time specially if I'm paying for monthly premium. I'm thinking of unsubscribing anytime soon. :(
It use to work on my phone. But now it won't open up. I'm stuck with the Netflix screen. It works on my laptop and iPad. But not on my phone. I'm pretty sad. Hopefully it's just because they're fixing some bugs on it.
"Usually a seamless experience but for the past few days, I've been having issues with it. It buffers a lot and the resolution keeps dropping. Other apps are working just fine, so it's not my connection. Please, help resolve this issue"
Love that this app allows me to do screen in screen on my Google phone so it doesn't have to take up my entire screen but wish the display could be brighter. The brightness even turned all the way up is still extremely dark.
"Usually I love Netflix. I love the shows, well most of them. I don't like that the are okay with allowing movies or shows of young children to be sexualized. Also I ended my membership last month and got charged this month. As soon as they get rid of cuties I would be glad to come back but I don't want my money to support a company who supports children being sexualized. Update. I have tried twice to stop paying for this. They keep charging me. Idk what to do, but im really dissatisfied now"
I have this app on both my phone and fire stick and on my fire stick it messes up alot one minute you hear the audio then next you hear nothing and the show is still playing and not to mention the loading time will some times get stuck on 25% i don't know when the last time Netflix got an update on the fire stick
"When a movie is ending and the credits are playing.... The thumbnail for the next video is flashing hence I cannot read ,say for example, the songs , that are featured in the movie. Please do something about it . Thanks."
"2 days back I updated my poco f3 gt to MIUI 13. I thought everything went smooth until I opened Netflix. The video playback on it freezes after every 15 20 seconds but weirdly the audio and subtitles keep on playing, Please fix the issue ASAP."
Netflix Has Quality Contents To Entertain us No doubt But UI & Plans Sucks Seriously Other Apps has Direct Option while Watching we can change Quality As Preferred for Instant ..I feel Annoyed Let say It's Ok If want to See On TV & windows Upgrade Plan But Again if U hv download list On One Android Device U can't enjoy On TV Even If U hv Basic Plan (Not Everybody has Wifi ) Still It Needs Further Upgrades.. Sometimes it can't even Connect with Tv Casting.. Rqsting Netflix to Make It happen!!
"The continue watching for is not working . It worked fine on previous version . This version update is not up to the mark . And when ever i open the app after minimise , the app reloading and which was not happing on the previous version"
"I want to give it a 5 star because I loved the APP i really do. But the thing is my account is always hacked. I did everything, I changed my password every month. At first the hackers just watched (yeah for free) but now they even changed my password (which gladly I recovered using my phone number) i dont know how much I can tolerate this. I hope you can fix this. Please check or Maybe use some security before log in. Thank you"
While watching Jap Animes I am unable to read subtitles as in most cases both the background from show and subtile color are exactly the same.I tried watching the same show on TV and my iPhone and there it looks fine. I been facing this issue for months.Please do fix this problem.
"this is an ok app I guess but theres a lot of problems. 1.Since we have to sign it I can't what to know why? Because I have to buy it like Netflix I'm only 11 I don't want my perents to buy it 2.When downloading the show you really just can't sometimes because they would say ""sorry can't download!"" Or something else cuz idk since my tablet was broken I can't even watch my favorite show! That's all for now."
It's a really great app as you get variety in here..be it movies or series..only thing it's lacking is an english audio equivalent for movies and series which arent originally in english. It would really keep people hooked to it.
Content is very good but It is frustrating to not have forward option while casting on tv. Sometimes we just switch over to Prime because of it.. Only 30 second reverse option is there no forward option ...
I love Netflix but the app for a smartphone keeps say not connected to the Internet Netflix works fine on my console and my 4k smart TV just not on my phone could be fixed to a bug check for the app and a update to apply the fixes will change to 5 stars if fixed.
Netflix is a good application for watching movies. But if you are watching movies on smart tv so you can't change video quality from tv I think this is a bad option
"I love netflix, its got some good shows. I do wish that netflix would impliment a ""not interested"" button. Also if i try a show and decide I don't like it, there should be a button that allows me to get it off my continue watching."
"Wish I could customize what I see more or less of. And no duplicates. I hate seeing a movie I already passed showup on a different genre list just because it ""falls under that category also"""
"I have used Netflix for a long time now and its a good app, but there are a lot of bugs and errors, it won't let me watch anything on any device, and my profile got deleted without explanation."
Netflix is great I love Netflix it's it's just that it doesn't have my favorite movies like Ghostbusters or Godzilla king of monsters that's the only thing cuz all the old movies that used to show they're not there no more and I really love those movies and now they don't show them anymore so I'm really mad about that and I don't like that so Netflix should really change that and put all the whole movies back there like the swan princess Barbie pearl princess and other movies that we love.
"App works fine, don't like the woke stuff they keep adding, nor the factor some titles they show a preview for in English audio, then when you go to watch it , it's only in Japanese or some other audio language and only has English subs ( 'cowboy bebop' for example, and many others) . Chill on the woke far left trash or I'm dropping my membership and stop lying about what the audio language is in some titles with the misleading previews showing English audio diologue!!"
I believe it's quite unfair for users under the Basic plan to only be able to access 480p as the highest video quality. I'm unable to enjoy my movies and TV shows as I used to.
"Loved netflix til recent, now every time i turn something on it has closed captioning turned on and i have to fiddle with it to go off, logging out reseting from website and cache all fail to help. Its nothing major but slowly irritating over time."
Putting up a 1 star review since they ruined the UI. Constant auto-playing videos makes it hard to read and navigate. I get tired of looking at the screen well before I can decide what to watch.
"The app itself is good, the only problem is that I have a tablet that I used to take from some trips and download movies on it, and since some update the app stopped to work on it. The Model of the table is SM-T805M and the Android version is 6.0.1."
"Well let's just say that it has been a nice run. That said ,first I don't need to have your application pushing down my face that you can find me some program movies or TV show for me depending on what I watch, however between me and my BFF and I the choice are totally on the way way out in opposite spectrum and seeing that pertinent insistence gets the better of me ,your main competitor offers way way more at a more affordable rate than what you charge me.too much for my liking,thanks üëã"
I love the app but i dont like sudden changes to movies for example some disapear and some reapear also some change language. I watched one punch man like 5 times in english and suddenly its in japanese i mean sure i can change it back but it changed itself
Why in the hell are the subtitles turned on for every single episode? I have to turn them off every time a new episode starts! Please fix this because it's super annoying!! And if I pause a show I have to rewind ten seconds for it to play.
"Can't browse without subscription. I can buy only when I know which are all movies, series, shows available. You must enable free browsing of content (check other apps like hotstar, zee5, prime etc). I don't understand why mobile subscription is only 480p.. Make it atleast 720p, then it is worth to buy."
Why did you move the cast icon to somewhere more inconvenient? It's fine if you want to keep it a FAB but at least have it shift up when there's a player at the bottom of the screen. Right now it covers up the cast icon.
This app doesn't work on older devices - anything from and including Marshmallow down needs an older version of the app. If Netflix isn't already pre-installed you'll need to sideload an older apk. NOT EVERYONE has the latest gizmo!!!
"It's ok for the price charged.. but disappointed because I have requested titles so many times and they haven't added what I requested. My favorite movies like 'The A team' , 'scent of a woman' and 'Rush' (2013) are not available. :( Please add these movies"
Please fix subtitles so they can be read against light backgrounds. if all subtitles are always white they can almost never be seen against light background especially if you happen to be a person with poor eye sight.
"Y don't u allow bhim upi payment!? Many poeple are mostly transacting through that.. It would be beneficial ,helpful and easy to get membership for us . The payment option is only debit or either credit. Please I want u to improve the payment option."
I absolutely love Netflix but I hate how they always leave series hanging you know we got great series like some assembly required or home the Animated Series and sometimes they even remove Seasons like in zumbo's Just Desserts they have a season 2 but not a season 1 and I love those shows so maybe continue the shows on and all edit this review accordingly because I honestly missed those shows
"The selection is okay. It has a lot of great shows, but for anime it usually doesn't have every season even when they have been out for a very long time. Also Cuties brought the rating down a star."
I would of given it 5 stars but after the latest update when ever I'm watching anything on Netflix it just automatically stops what I'm watching and it's been doing it constantly. Netflix PLEASE!! fix this bug
I love Netflix and they are really stepping it up by adding newer shows. Now the app for some reason when I watch movies on my phone the screen is too dark to see it.
I love netflix but the thing is theres some movies or series that i dont have in mine. People give recommendations about some good to watch but then its not available in mine. It is because were not in the same country or what . Please netflix . I hope you can fix this or do something about this . Overall i enjoyed using netflix . Love from Malaysian‚ù§
I like the app but sometimes when I press the next episode button it just replays the video and because it does not show all episodes or seasons so I need to watch it on YouTube and it only has clips on YouTube or it is the full episode in a different language that I don't understand
Please fix the glitch.. The picture is freezing as the sound is continuously going on. I thought if i press pause and play it would be fine but IT IS NOT... it just happened today.... Please fix it... Coz this one is my source of entertainment..
"We love using netflix but can you add more great movies? You keep adding horror films which I am not a fan of or mostly we are not a fan or rather we don't like it. Can you add more series/movies of other genre like anime, romance, comedy, Filipino and more latest western movies. We watch netflix every single day. Keep adding more movies for more option."
"Downloaded to my galaxy note 5. When I turn my phone on I keep getting a notification that says ""shortcut to Netflix already exists"". I turned off all notification permissions and it still pops up. So annoying. Thinking of just deleting the app."
"every time i open the app it says ""we were not able to reach netflix service"" and i tries reinstalling the app but that didnt help. i will give only a neutral review because the wpp when it works is good but ive been trying for hours."
"Stopped working. Tried force stop and reopening it, tried redownloading it, updating it, and transfering it to my SD card and it still refuses to go past the logo screen (and that's if it can get past the blank screen first)."
"It would be great, if while playback, you are able to show the display resolution such as hd. full hd, uhd, etc. because sometimes the resolution varies with streaming bandwidth based on the inyernet connection."
"It's a decent app vut since the update My List has been broken. I cannot add or remove things to my list and it's starting to get very very frustrating, i would give it more stars but this is ridiculous."
"Up until 1/21/202 I was able to watch this app on my tablet, now I am getting error (-9) and can not connect to Netflix, please try again later. I have spent 2-1/2 hours between my internet provider ( netfilx recommended I call them) and Netfix, themselves. Nothing worked, they wanted me to uninstall google play store because I am running it on an Amazon Fire tablet. I had to pay $65 to a computer store to get Google play store installed. It was not something I could get installed on my own, I tried. Netflix wanted me to uninstall it and and I was not willing. So no streaming on my tablet which up until 1/21/2020 worked! ready to cancel my service all together...netfix on my laptop or tv still work. Not on the tablet"
"Can see why they are leaving America until last when it comes to the price/account changing. Australia is not short of streaming agencies these days, America has so many more. The new levels to packages definitely need tweaking. While I understand they want to limit the account sharing because more accounts more money (gag) household one, 2 devices for even a couple is inconvenient considering most homes have 2 TVs plus 2 phones and a tablet. The constant updating is becoming tedious."
"Good for occassions when you want it. Very big app for a phone with little storage. Unless you cant, you may as well use netflix on a console/pc or a phone/tablet with decent storage."
You are taking off all of the good shows. And when i try to search it up it says its gone. I am now disliking this app because sometimes its hard to use. Anyways this was my favorite app can you see if you can get ANT Farm back on. DONT TAKE THE OFFICE OFF.But i do like the no ads part
I already installed and uninstalled the app but still it shows the black screen with netflix on it. I cannot watch movies too waiting for that. I don't know if it is just loading or what.
"I am fine with the content, but unhappy with the app. I usually download stuff and keep for watching later. The app gives me device failure with some error message once in a while and I have to reinstall the app causing all my app data to erase. Please look into this."
"Tbh, everything about netflix is pretty cool. The movies, series, anime n all buh my problem here right now is that the download process is really slow upon my WiFi got full internet connection. Please I need this issue fixed ASAP"
"I am using Netflix app in my OnePlus 7 phone and getting error screen frequently with ""there is problem while playing the video . please try again later"" I have restart the phone as well as uninstall and then install the app but issue is same ."
"Okay so... most times when i try to log in its saying wrong password WHEN ITS RIGHT(as i try it on another device and it works) also i know its right because when i try to create a new password with the password it says is wrong, it basically tells me i can't use my previous passwordüò§. Its really frustrating because it happens ALLLLLL the time, in my TV, phone and PC"
"IDK why. But when I'm watching movies and in the main menu I get a ""device failure occurred"" prompt on my Galaxy Note10+ 5G. But I think it's because I'm watching in full HD and at HDR10+, and when it told me to restart my device I did that, and the playback specification said ""SD"" and no HDR. Fix it."
App is Fine but Netflix sucks and is overpriced. On top of being the priciest and offers no grandfather prices or locked prices for older members they just let you know they'll ne demanding more money every month. Not to mention there's NOTHING they have that can't be watched elsewhere for FREE and for the highest price they offer the least and take the longest to make new content available. Canceling for sure
"I think the layout could be better, is annoying how it says errors with downloads but then offer no way to remove these errors?! So I have a 4 error red warning box but I have not got a clue what is causing the errors, all my downloaded files in folder are error free!"
"Great choice of shows and movies but the lay out SUCKS! Every time you open the app, ""watchlist or continue watching"" it randomizes them! Can't keep chronological order for nothing! VERY FRUSTRATING!"
The app is getting pretty buggy lately. Logs out randomly especially when trying to skip scenes in downloaded videos. Also fails to log in even with the correct credentials following that.
"deserve more positive rates its so cooool and great you can watch full movies its great like i wanted to watch full movies of shrek and there we have it full movies to go edit: i was wrong the movies are dissapearing and i want to watch it again like hotel transylvania3,coco,angry birds the movies are disappearing no matter how much you search it"
I dont of it a bug or something but I haven't been able to use Netflix for over two weeks now it works fine on my tv and computer but not my phone at all. I hope you guys fix this soon.
"It's really hard to purchase, I already set the payment method but it was decline n it said that ""there were problems, try again later"" it's been 3 days n I still can't use the app üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠. I gave it 3 star cause there r still a lot of show that I can't find on Netflix, for example Mr. Bones, god must be crazy n still many more but so far I love using it to watch other like Lucifer n The Good Doctor"
"The app randomly messes up. The audio keeps playing, but the visuals stop completely. If not that, it has a black screen with audio playing in the background."
"can we please just have a way of watching netflix with friends?you used to be able to do that on Rave but you cant anymore. something like that would be amazing,where we can all get into one ""virtual"" room and then we decide on one show and just start watching it together. i wouldnt even mind ads like in television but just let us have a way of watching netflix together."
Why cant I change the font color? Its almost impossible to read with white font when there is already so much light in almost all dramas. Also i liked the older app better. It was much faster and friendly to use. Please ask your regular users for feedback before changing. Thanks
"When my netflix plan ended, I went to update plan in the app menu section but didn't see anything like that and then signed out of the account. And then restarted the app and signed in and then restart your membership was showing in the app. I wanted to update membership my membership was monthly I wanted yearly the plan was not showing....So what can I do please update your app.... Install the function change the plans......"
I love Netflix but recently I've been haveing a issue were only on my phone the video audio will play but the screen is black and some times the video will work fine for 3 to 5 minutes then it will start to glitch and start to skip around.
You should put together a team to dub everything in all the languages you offer. It's sad to miss out on something you really want to see all because it's not in your language or too difficult to try and watch it with subtitles/takes too long and not everyone has time to learn multiple new languages
;Netflix; as an app your excellent. You have excellent content and you buffer well. But if I am paying a monthly subscription fee don't piss me off by playing advertisements over the credits of the productions I actually want to watch. I am an adult and I'll watch what I choose. If I wanted advertisements I'd watch Murdoch media and if you want subscribers you wouldn't treat me like a half wit. So stop it!
App is good & its contents.. But need to Improve a lot & make a more friendly UI look. App drains battery quickly even while using high speed internet/wifi. Love to see new fresh look & lite app.
"I have been having a problem on Netflix for months where the screen goes black whilst the audio continues (Error 5.10), I have reported this problem to the help center twice and said they couldn't fix it. Please fix this problem!"
"I feel like the shows and movies on Netflix are quickly getting worse and worse. There is nothing ever new on it. And some of the best shows have either been taken off or about to get taken off. I feel like when ever I am looking for something new, it is the same stuff. Though I do like The Office. That's why it got the stars that it did. Though they are about to take that off too. Come on Netflix... Really"
"It's ok, I see the exact same movies and shows in here daily. Nothing new really. We get about 10 new shows that noone else watches or just never heard of. Most shows I watch are B rated shows, or really good to the point where they should've been on the big screen. Can we get more new shows instead of shows we watched 50 years ago? That would be great."
"It has good Titles... but the Household update is the worst ever... It's too much... I hipe they remove it... Because not all people are rich. I live in two Households, each have one TV so it can be a problem If I logged it in one of our TVs. I'll have to pay another slot so that I can log it in... Please remove that feature. It's the worst feature ever created, unlike other streaming apps. They just let us share it into any amount of Households, but most people share it into two Households."
I did the payment one week ago and now its showing there has been some issue on payment. I just didnt get it so i tried consulting customer care. And the customer care service is quite bad in india (i dont know about other) i tried calling but the number could not get connected and tried chatting but they seem so impatient and in one single day i have tried chatting more than ten times every time the another person gets connected i have to explain whole thing again . This really is irritating.
"Update - If you raise your prices again I am leaving. I am paying over double now. What does this new update do? Whenever I look at the description it says - not worry about it, just worry what to watch! It was funny the first time, this is the fourth time it has said that which isn't so laughable anymore. My devices are expensive and important I am careful with them. You have hiked your subscription price three times but can't be bothered to write a description for the updates of your app?"
"Why can't choose 480p, 360p downloads? Not everybody has fast internet. when i leave the app for a second to answer a message, the whole episode closed and the buffering wasn't saved. Let some buffering be saved for fast continued viewing like YouTube."
"For those using an Xperia 1 V, I have raised a support ticket with Netflix which has been passed to the technical department to enable HDR10 (as this is even available on the previous model), and also to look at enabling Ultra HD and Dolby Atmos support too."
"Where did 47 metres down disappear too? My original country is Australia, and i traveled to japan in which i saw my netflix movies expand to ones that arent in australia and when i went to sri lanka it didnt change but stayed the same as japan. I gave my account to someone else in sri lanka and netflix stopped working for him. And a few days later the movie we were watching 47 metres down disappeared. where did it go? it and along with it other movies such as the flash seriess."
I will give a 5-star but the last four episodes of avatar The Last Airbender are nowhere to be found on Netflix... Well they are but it's unavailable in my region I watch the entire series except for the last four episodes in my region just the last four episodes are not available in my region explained that you fix that problem and you'll get five stars
"I have other apps that I watch movies and series on however, I decided to download netflix to check if they have a specific spanish drama that I was looking for since the other apps that i used didn't. I downloaded it on the 15th of February and you guys took money from my account on the same 15th even tho I hadn't watched anything. I didn't even find the drama i was looking for!!"
"Here are some suggestions from me to make it better . Give options to directly add or remove content for my list , everytime I have to open /click on the contents then add to my list or remove option appears. 2. Give information about the languages available. 3. Give IMDB ratings , crew or casts information. 4. No personalized contents."
"You can't browse the entirety of available content, just the featured films/series. You can only either search a movie if it's available or browse in the current feed. Most movies and series are terrible, some of the good stuff are not in netflix."
"The shows are okay, there are a lot of shows that the dub that I feel they could offer just subtitles, but mostly what I do not like is even if I keep the app updated I have to unistall it after each update for it to work and not just stay on the netflix letters."
Overall Very well optimize but still I am facing few major issues like I put a lock at my profile and its not even working I press back in profile menu and it automatically log into my locked profile without any restriction. How am I suppose to trust in this app if this directly breaching my privacy and I shared my account with other at that reason ita more questionable to put this untrustworthy feature. #Security_Problem
Get more scary movies for Halloween. On Christmas get more christmas movies ect. Bottom line people love horror movies and scary movies. Anything thats low budget junk remove it. Only decent movies should exist. Not a bunch of low budget garbage. Also when you add new movies please keep them in front on your watch list not all mixed in so i cant even see the new movies i added or i forgot i added one because its way down the line mixed in in my watchlist causing me to never see it .
"Hi! I would like to report something important. We have an account in netflix, this happened a while ago, we received a notification that we have a bill of Php 549 for Ultra Hd premium account, we are currently subscribed for Php 149 standard account (lowest payment), then we check our netflix account, we only have 2 user, (me and my husband) for at least 3 devices. But then we saw a unauthorized name (which is not in our language), he is using our account but we dont know him , his in the list."
"Netflix has been steadily declining but it is still a good streaming service, still got HEAPS of good movies and shows. I just wish their catalog wasn't getting quietly trimmed of all the best stuff or if not outright removal they're limited to certain countries."
I love this app but i dont like how if I am in a different state I now have to get a code to login in but I have been logged in with this phone since I got Netflix
"Used to love netflix but they've raised their prices 3 times in a year!! They don't even keep up with the tv shows that they used to, such as twd. Will be cancelling netflix very soon. Prime video is much better and almost $10 cheaper!!"
I love Netflix when I started using it but after some months it started to show me some issue about subtitles subtitle started to glow without any reason even tho I never get that thing. @Netflix please do something about subtitles and also give us option to change subtitle appearance from the app.
"I unable to connect and some of the movie that i saved in my list was gone without even a notice. i hope they could have just give us a fair warning that they will be removing the moview soon enough se we could have watch it right away. also, animes that was once dubbed in the past should be available too on netflix."
"Why can't I watch downloaded movies? Video is playing, I can hear audio, but no motion image. Just a black screen with audio. What could be responsible? I've deleted the app and re-installed the latest update, yet no improvement. Same thing. Do somethig about it pls"
"Netflix will not let me watch gossip girl or pretty little liars. When it told me to try again later I tries again the next day but it still won't work. I did all of the things it told me to but guess what?! it still don't work:( But anyway it works on my TV still and there are sone AMAZING shows on there its just annoying how my two favourite shows, gossip girl and pll, WON'T workkk. ps. i recommend the show friday night dinner- its sooo funny XD"
"It has a lot of the shows I love and watch but recently I've been experiencing bugs where shows will randomly disappear then re appear, sometimes if I search hard enough I'll be able to find the show but none of their episodes are listed. I would really appreciate if this bug was fixed because it's extremely inconvenient."
This app is really good no buffering and lagging the only issue that I'm currently facing right now is the anime updates. Your anime series are all outdated. For example Black Clover already released 170 episodes and here you can only watch until episode 155 and that is kinda annoying since i use netflix to watch anime :/
It gets boring and boring every year like they make a movie but it has no rates and still keep it on netflix
"If you are facing any issue in opening the application in your phone, clear the chace and dada from app setting and try to open the app if not working then you can restart your cell phone and try to open this application it will work. I hope this helps if your Netflix is not operating and is loading for a long time."
"The app itself is pretty solid, except for a couple minor things like sometimes when i watch my downloads it will take me back to previous chapters, everything is nice. My issue, and the readon this review is only 3 stars is the catalogue. In my opinion, Netflix could be one of the better anime steaming sites if they just added more anime and invested in making good Netflix Original animes AND PUT ALL THE SEASONS. No one wants a new Kissing Booth movie, or ANOTHER 13RW season. Add color themes!"
"Recently skipping backwards and forwards 10 seconds has become odd, music plays and it freezes and then it goes to the frame it was meant to be at, it's annoying, and you took off Jonah from Tonga too. That's all that needs improvement otherwise it'd be a 5 star"
So i love this app but i hate whn your in separt households you can't share your account without having to pay a extra expense.
Netflix is a great app for on the move people like me.... But Offlately the app is freezing and I am not been able to watch anything. Everytime I have to uninstall and reinstall it and in the process I alway loose my dowloaded files. Pls look into this.
I'm not too happy that doe not allow split view or pop up screen. What's the point of being able to download if the video can only be played with Netflix app and not a different video playing app.
The autopay setting is very unnecessary.....
"This is a has app with a big selection but not the best way to stream anime, sure it's ad free but it takes a long time to load up episodes and the description s it gives to its shows are so inaccurate. Also searching for things is horrible, it brings thing not relivent to your search and recommends to search for stuff that's not even on it streaming platform. Overall I'm disappointed at this app!"
"I wish Netflix would add more movies with Morgan Freeman in them. ALSO, can we talk about those annoying descriptions that Netflix adds to a movie/show. The descriptions are terrible! Just use the ones that the movie originally uses."
"I love Netflix as it is easy to use and great for travelling, however mine keeps glitching and I think if it has part of a series of films (e.g. the Divergent Series) they should have all of the films especially when there is a part one and two of a film and they only have one part"
"Netflix needs to stop taking down shows, because there are many people who enjoy those shows, but can no longer watch them, because Netflix decided to take down a lot of things. People are paying for a Netflix subscription so that they can watch their shows, however, the shows that they want to watch get taken down, so what on earth are people paying for, then? What is the purpose of taking down popular shows? By doing this, Netflix will be losing a lot of patrons, and its reputation. Shame :("
"Not good. You Cannot find the best movies like Indiana Jones series, the terminal, the patriot, the pianist, hacksaw ridge and so many other movies.i don't know why is that. I can find all this movie in Amazon Prime. Please see this because if this type of best movie is not available then it's not an good streming app. And that's not good."
Its is good. I wish you could add where we can select the resolution for the video not the automatic it will change to 720p or 1080p. I wish you could put the feature. I will give 5stars for that. Thank you
what happened to the mini screen/ picture in picture!? i was finally able to multitask while watching my shows on my phone. i could play angry birds and watch Arrow at the same now the screen wont minimize at all after this update! boo! i want to be able to still watch a show while sending a text!
My shows stop/pause every 30 seconds and i have to hit play everytime it stops. Otherwise the app is fantastic. Picture quality is sharpas I've ever seem on an Android phone. Fix the freezing issue and I'll give 5 stars.
Netflix please fix the issue on this app. It makes my device widevine L3. It supposed to be HD widevine L1 because my device supported it. But the app is changing the playback specification. I hope you can make a fast action on this one.
Used to work fine but now I find the video lags and does this matrix kind of deal. The audio isn't affected just the video. So frustrating. For the amount I pay for years service I would think the video quality would be better.
"It was great when it first started. Now the subscriptions are going up.I started out paying 9.99 a month. I guess Hollywood is getting greedy asking for a bigger cut. Also there were more low budget independent films were when I first subscribed..more independent African American films, Latino films, Urban films.Those films were fun to watch even the production values were not Hollywood levels but with those movies shot on DSLR they were presentable. Also its hard to find 1950s movies ."
"Works great, just one annoying feature. Get rid of the ""Are you still watching X?"" feature and just let it play until there's nothing more to show, I hate having to get up every 3-4 episodes and start the damn thing again."
"Like this app is good I've used it without any problems until like 2 days ago it keeps crashing and it says I have to update so I do but it still crashes and the weird thing is I can't even Uninstall it, it just unistalls the update but that's it, it's getting very annoying, I wou,d appreciate it if u could fix it something please, thank u"
"I cannot hear sound when the next episode plays,no matter I use a headphone or a BT speaker. Issue no2.... If I decrease the screen brightness to minimum at night time,the screen goes blank. Restart doesn't help, everything works after 10 mins. Mobile model: Xiaomi MI A3 Android 10..... Netflix is updated to latest version."
"When it works it works well, however I often find myself looking at a loading wheel lately that never stops spinning, all I can do is not use the app for a while(no less than hours) then come back to it. I have a Samsung galaxy A70 runing android 9 if that helps any."
"Don't know if Netflix Corp will see this or not but, my family has been subscribers for years now, even with price increases. However, if we are charged extra or penalized for using our own account on other devices while away from home we will cancel! This new password sharing rule is going to lose you more customers unless you're able to differentiate between password sharing and customers utilizing their own accounts elsewhere."
"bugs. When I connect to chromecast, if i click a movie/show too quickly it wont play. My list is no longer updating. this is the 2nd time this has happened. i had to delete my profile last time."
"Netflix is great but so far its been glitchy on its new updates when i watch my tv series and i exit out, it does not save the last episode i was takes me back an episode before that one and starting half way or almost finishing Please Netflix fix this issue and i can change it to 5 stars since its great only defect is glitchy"
Was better earlier now it keeps on hanging whenever I fast forward or rewind. Even skip button causes the same issue. I have ample ram on my phone so that definitely is not an issue. Please fix it asap. It's ruining the experience
"There are no shows that you'd really like to see. Only if you are into Netflix Originals, then you should get it. There is no Big bang theory, supernatural or new movie releases. Just few old movies and series (that too with couple of seasons missing) 3 stars because App works flawlessly. If I still have to scrape for US series on the Internet, why should I get Netflix."
"I really like the service, but noticed that the Android app does not offer 5.1 surround sound for any movie, even though the 5.1 icon shows up on the Windows 10 app for the same movies. I want to cast movies to my home theater with 5.1 via Chromecast, but cannot do that now."
Great app but it has 2 issues first one i tried to login my account on my laptop i can't login it gives me an prompt that password is incorrect but at the same time it's up and running on my phone second issue is that whenever i switch the app to another one and play some media in background the app resume the movie or show and that a bug.
Good App. But I feel that audio quality should be improved because with out headphones viewing a show is not possible... They should provide options to remove a program from continue watching as it becomes clumpsy while we watch different shows ...
"I love Netflix. However, the fact that we can watch Netflix based on the country we lived in, that makes me annoyed. I don't know how it works but I paid too much just for watching something I don't like or I'm bored with? And I do have some movies which are not able to be watched here in my country. That's so sucks. Why you need to adjust with country you lived in just to watch movies or dramas? Can you give all free or just delete your regulation about ""watching based on country"" thing. Please"
"Really needs a way to disable or hide mobile games. They feel like ads on a mobile and now are being embedded in show/movie sections. It's just clutter and I'd rather use Amazon Video, Disney+, or Paramount apps because it's getting annoying an intrusive."
It's good. But you don't provide cast option like amazon. So it's very much required. Please give the cast option so that we can enjoy shows on tv. Everyone doesn't have unlimited wifi connection.
The app was working fine until I updated my phone now it doesn't want to play and its a factory app that came with my phone so I can't just uninstall it. I tried taking the updates off the app and even went to the FAQ and did what it said and nothing. I'm still getting a device error code which is unfortunate because unless I'm home this is the only device I can use it on.
+It's a working streaming service. +Video and sound quality are usually good. - They've introduced obnoxious and unnecessary notifications. No one wants updates on shows they've never shown interest in. - They keep raising the price for no reason as well.
"Would have given 5 stars only if I got better contents on my account. I just activated my account not too long and I discovered most of the movies on the categories are not recent. I can't find a movie titled ""A quiet place"" instead I'm seeing movies I've watched already as coming soon and most of the movies I'm seeing feels like my account was backdated to 3 years back. It feels frustrating to having to open a Netflix account and not having a better experience compared to other random sites."
"Netflix has to add more tv shows and movies, I have it for months and it is boring now, I'm thinking to cancel this app, nothing is added and some of the really good tv shows are missing...like ,,One Tree Hill"" , ,,Revenge"" , ,,Devious maids"" , ,,Desperate housewives"" ......and much more..... ,,Sex and the city"" as well.....if you want to charge for something you have to improve it from time to time and add new things because it is boring..."
It is a very good paid app.. The video quality is quite impressive.. But the only thing i don't like here is that the annual subscription plan is very costly.. I don't get any benefit in annual plan. It's same like paying monthly subscription.. I hope it gets down soon
"The subtitle's synchronization with the video is sometimes not great ( one way to fix this is letting the user customize the it manually every time they watch a video with said problem ). Other than that, its okay"
I have an issue from my last Netflix's update in my Android. My downloads doesn't work I have the 2.100 error. Looks like the app thinks it's another device or something like that. I am waiting for the next update and if it doesn't fix the problem I will reinstall the app and download everything again :(
"The programmes are good. However the app kills my phone's battery, even if it is not open at all. If I simply download it and leave it it drains the battery. So I've just installed it to watch a programme, in an hour's time I will uninstall it again. This should not be necessary."
"Netflix is a really good app and it hurts me to rate it 3stars but, The videos keep stopping while the audio continues to play. Recently I can no longer watch any movies. The app opens but it doesn't show my movies. Please fix this"
"Netflix has been very useful for me until I got my new phone. Recently, whenever I go on Netflix the videos will pause or slow down, and the only way to resolve it is by restarting the phone every time I open the app. Please fix this"
Lately the app is showing some problems as in while I am watching an episode and j move on to the next one or I lock my phone and try to resume a a certain episode the sound stops working please fix the bug because all the permissions are granted and the others apps are working just fine Thanks
Would like to have a setting to be able to disable the post credit auto skip function. The current function is useful but would also like to have the freedom to off this feature as in some dramas i do enjoy the post credit songs.
I love Netflix but the mobile app is so frustrating in that it doesn't show you what you've watched. I'm forever re-watching episodes just to find where I was up to. Please bring back the watched indicator.
Netflix is great for binge-watching movies but it does not provide all the movies I hoped I could see. And it gets rid of certain shows/movies depending on ratings which is frustrating because some people enjoy watching those shows/movies.
1) change the layout so I can filter out movies that dont show on a native language 2)I want to be able to remove movies from the list if I start watching and dont like it 3)better movie selection required. 4) stop adding movies that were added before and saying they are new. More personalization required
"Could you remove brightness control or make it optional please? What is the point of it anyway? It's so annoying to tune brightness on phone AND in the app... I set brightness lower on the app, then when I switch to other app, brightness switches to higher, system one, which is really unpleasant for the eyes. It's great app, could you please stop overthinking and overengineering it..."
"I think netflix is such a great app it's useful on road trips vacations and to distract the grandchildren ü§£ . But it had such great shows with great reviews and yet got rid of them,so now I have to use my normal television which makes it so much harder ."
Can you create a separate category for Netflix Originals divided into Movies and Series? It's a bit difficult to search for it and get a few results. Can you also do something about the results? The search results only provide a limited quantity which sucks big time. And the region restriction content is the big downside here. Hoping you can stop doing that.
"I have had Netflix for a decade and have never had a problem with them until now. We are in the middle of an unprecedented global pandemic with millions of americans unemployed and hurting for money. I could not pay Netflix. I thought to myself, ""It's a pandemic, they won't just cut me off. So many companies are helping their customers in this period of uncertaintity, I should have a week or so to fix this...right?"" No. Not at all. Immediatly cut off. That's not right. Netflix should do better."
Works great on TVs but is absolute trash on phones and tablets. Constantly crashes to main menu 2 or 3 times per episode and you have to shut subtitles off every single episode. It makes it almost unusable on anything except a TV.
"Loved the app until it disappeared from my app list and I have to search it in the play store every time I want to use it, it never had to be reinstalled, although I have tried to uninstall and reinstall and still nothing, it shows up when searched each time through the play store"
"when i dowload episodes and turn on automatic downloads, after it downloads some episodes it freezes and does not let me download more episodes or other series or movies and I have to uninstall the app and install it again. It has already happened five times this week."
"Hi, The app was great but just after the latest update it keeps crashing. It's showing device failure occurred & automatically shut down. It is happening several times while watching. Please fix this. Thanks."
"It was a great app until this last update. I used to be able to watch certain shows over cellular data. Now I have to wait till I get home, every 2 weeks, to watch those shows because I have to use a wifi ip address"
"its realy annoiying that u have to hold your phone upright when your using the app on your phone, and theres too much indie stuff coming in other then that it has desent shows, the movies though they basically recycle them,it will be there for a while, leave and then come back, new movies dont come through as much as they should"
"I subscribed Netflix via mobile. When I watched netflix via mobile phone, the screen become dark and I am not able to adjust the level of brightness as the msg prompt that it has been controlled by apps. Any advise? Or is it mobile plan can only like that? Thanks"
"Why do you guys always add the sequels to movies but not the first movie? It makes no sense, you have the second spiderman but not the first. Same with shows, why don't you add the first few seasons instead of the later seasons, you did it with regular show and adventure time and it's annoying. I don't even know why I bother making this review because it's not like you guys at Netflix are reading the reviews."
"There is a issue with this App, while on screen mirroring from mobile to tv only audio comes and screen overlay appers the main video is missing...( Black), while on other app it is working properly on same set of mobile & tv. Need to resolve it."
I use this app a lot but Recently I'm unhappy I download shows only to find I can't play then because of 7.5 error and the page it leads to doesn't help at all . I lose all that data for nothing (mind data is very expensive in my country) its frustrating the only way to play is to delete . They need to fix this bug or inform us not to download . Also add more well made Christian content please. Please make a function that can remove shows I find offensive of my timeline
The price is too high for what movies and tv shows that are offered. When I search for a hit movie that is played on other popular apps Netflix doesn't have them. Need to get up to date movies and tv shows.
With the new update you have disabled variable playback speed! Please get it back for users who binge watch. It's a matter of life and death! Many a times variable playback is the deal breaker on whether to start a new series on Amazon prime or Netflix!
"Everything's great...... except, the only thing I'm not liking is its start up time...... It takes too long to open up and one has to wait staring at it like an owl......it's frustrating......or else I would have definitely rated it 5 star..... Please fix this problem soon....."
Love Netflix and I doubt anyone in the world would disagree. What's really confusing is the lack of trailers from the Android app that definitely exists on the web version of their app. I'd love to watch a trailer before diving into a new show lol
"It really is a good app but, lately whenever i try downloading new movies i don't always see them on my download list which is really annoying. For instance i tried downloading a korean movie and i've downloaded to episode 8 and now i can't find it on my download list, searched it up again and it's like i've not even downloaded any episode in the process wasting my data. So please fix it."
"It not to bad , get to watch movies when it loads ,last week I havent been able to connect to their server ( I dont know why , never had problem before) . Need to update movies more and dont wipe out movies that havent finished their season. Many times iv started a series and I get half way and netflix take the movie away ."
"To be quite Frank, they remove a lot of shows/films people would love to have been kept, and they have social platforms to listen to them to yet do not do so. I'm also starting to have an increasing grudge against the fact that you cannot have more than one device playing Netflix at the same time unless you upgrade the plan?! Shambles, not everyone has the money to keep up with Netflix's increasing needs"
Great app other then when i go to the categories it seems like there is the same movies and in the different categories where they should be different ones. For example .. if I look up funny comedies and there is movies that is horror or family and it's not supposed to be in that category that's what I'm talking about that's what I don't like about Netflix everything else is Awesome on Netflix I love how everything changes movies and shows. I love how it's easy to get around in the app.
Streaming is fine ... Smart download is cool... App works great just the lack of good content is what kills it. I will say the thing that makes me keep my account is I can change the language I'm streaming maby you can do it with other apps but I never figured it out so I'll stay with Netflix.
"I'd give you 5 stars Netflix BUT unfortunately, you say, access unlimited movies but most of what I want to watch is not there. Please, give every country access to all the movies, shows, series and anime collection you have. Please change this location thing"
I would like to address a glich or bug in your app. As if i lock the movie it doesn't allow me to unlock i have to close the app and restart it also if i switch the apps while playing movie on Netflix it just crash my screen i notice this in my both of phones... Kindly address it.
"I download shows to watch them offline but recently I've realised it shows that the download is in progress but when I check the notification bar, it's on the same percent. So I have to force stop the app and then go back and download the show all over again."
"I downloaded some series and eveyrtime i turn off the wifi, it cannot load it says something is wrong. Sometimes it keeps loadin and loading. The downloaded vides aren't yet expired so i dont know why it keeps happening. Tried clearing data and uninstall install it keeps happening. Please fix this thank you"
It's a great app but I live in the Caribbean and because of that I don't have access to certain movies or shows as if I lived in the UK and it's really upsetting that you can't be able to watch what you want to on netflix because of the region or country you live in.
This app has almost always been great until recently. Not sure if there was an update but now I have to log out and log back in every time I want to connect to Chromecast. It is VERY frustrating.
Was a good service but with yet another increase in price and too much not worth watching as lots of the added movies are incredibly old and seen a hundred times already. Last few months of my subscription I was rewatching movies I had watched a few months earlier. No point paying more for the same material.
"I know,I know.This is great,but as much as I hoped so,you can't have a 30 free day trial.That upsets me,Because,Well,I can't afford to buy something like this just to watch something.As much as I appreciate this,I really hope that soon you update this so that people that cannot afford it can have a 30 free day trial,Like me.Although you would like to make money,Most things have a free trail so I'm kind of upset that this doesn't.Either way,I hope you add one.This is a great app though!"
"Video brightness doesn't go back to dynamic. If you change the brightness, it will have a static brightness and not readjust based on light sensor. Very inconvenient when watching at night and switching back in the morning."
"I always enjoy Netflix but for whatever reason after I updated my app this time, it refuses to open and is freezing. I have already paid my monthly subscription bill yet I am not able to watch it. Please help"
"I wish they had Korean audio and subtitle options for more movies. They will have them, and then take them away after just a short time! It's so frustrating especially to see no Korean audio/subtitle options for KOREAN shows!!! I like for my son to watch Korean cartoons in Korean, but it isn't even an option on many of those shows now. So disappointing."
"Since the last two updates, I cannot turn off the closed captions. There is literally no way to turn it off. It will give you the languages you want them in, but no off option. Very annoying. I might cancel if not fixed by the next update."
"Can't see. It's always too dark, even if I turn the brightness of my Samsung Galaxy Z flip 3 phone. It's so annoying. The brightness of the Netflix app is always on the highest setting."
sometimes the chosen show will only play audio and a black screen. ive noticed that it's a problem in the app. i do not have this problem on my laptop. <3 other than that it is great.
"Great exclusive content! one thing I would like ""Netflix"" to have is another mid-tier payment subscription because some people; in my case, me and my families don't care about 4K (TV) but use in large number in smartphones and tablets. Another affordable payment subsribtion option would be great!"
"Latest update won't autorotate on Samsung Android phone and Tablet. Netfix support was not helpful. Natfix is stuck in portrait view, while every other app autorotates as usual. This is the first time I've ever had a problem with the app, but its a big problem."
The app doesn't support fullscreen viewing for phones with punch holes or notches. Just fills the space with black bars at the top and bottom and results in a small windowed display for videos.
"Most of the tv shows are late with newest seasons, outdated, and definitely not worthy of $9,99/month. Also everytime I have to search for a good movie for over half an hour just to end up watching something I already watched before since rest of the stuff are boring."
The streaming quality is really bad in the app. It just doesn't play in HD for new shows and ood shows too sometimes. Its annoying.. Can't you put the option bof stream quality like YouTube? So that the user can set the resolution.
"The play next episode feature is annoying. I usually play Netflix over Chromecast and since this has been introduced instead of automatically playing it, it will play one episode then I'm shown a message on the TV to click to play the next episode. This is where its an issue, I open the Netflix app from background and there's no option to play the next episode. I have to click on the programme again to find the episode I want to play."
"I don't know what's happening but when I open netflix, black screen will only show up ig the new update gives more bug than the old updates, I'm just wasting my subscription ;( pls fix them because I download a lot der and has reach it limit I don't want to put my downloads to wasteas internet here are poor so pls fix these, I used to love netflix but now.. I can't say it"
"App not functioning properly, After watching a complete episode of a tv series and moving to the next episode, and exiting the app when you again reopen it, the app shows the same last episode that you have already watched instead it should be showing the one that is currently being watched."
"Absolutely wonderful. Would suggest they expand their catalogue. All in all, great app. Keep it up. A variable playback speed option would really be appreciated! Addition of one will ensure a five star rating from me."
Every few weeks or even sooner I have to delete the app and re-download because on my phone the brightness will go dim. Its fine if its in the home screen or in pic in pic but full screen it so dark I can't see a thing. My only fix is to delete and reinstall. Otherwise I love the app.
I hate it when I have to log in each time I want to watch something else while ihad started another movie and then didn't want to see it. Why cant i just move back and find something else?? Also very limited series release. Annoying. Old movies seem very limited too. Lots of run of the mill movies of no interest to me. Good family movies with less crime and sexual exposure is needed. There is no need to promote sexual craziness especially showing very young girls in exposed situations.
my app just got insane.right now it just automatically turn off and cancel what I am watching.this is not the first time but right now it made me complete nuts
"App and user interface is great. Picture qualities are awesome. Where it not great is the content part, especially the inability to view other region contents. I watch UAE cotent and its not very great. After a few months of usage i saw all the cotents I like, and have been waiting for better new contents, but hardly anything. DOcumentaries are not great either. Its not more than a time pass. YouTube has better content"
"Very nice collection. Just have a problem that I am the only one using Netflix in my family, when I took the mobile and basic plan I had very low video quality, so i changed to standard which is too costly as i am the only one I it.... Please bring a pack with a mobile plan with 1080p or atleast 720p"
"The tadum sound accompanying the logo is disturbingly loud. The volume is way too loud when the automatic video start up begin. I've tried muting, but muting is can led before each new auto video start. I hate the auto starts. I can't concentrate on what I'm looking for. Give some control back to your subscribers Netflix. Michael"
Not giving 5 stars because of the problems I'm facing since the new update. The play button doesn't work most of the times. There's always a glitch in the subtitles. Also the forced recommendations.
"After paying for and enjoying Netflix for many years, in this time of crisis for so many of us, my service was stopped within hours of a rejected payment. I am aghast that this was done, and so quickly. Now I see that Netflix is like so many other companies...all about the money and nothing for the people."
This app is great and so many ways but what is terrible is that whenever apps are updating in the background which seems to be almost everyday for each app minimises the video playback or closes it all together so I have to click and open the content I'm watching about 20 times during app updates which is infuriatingly annoying
"Its okay i guess, there are some shows on netflix but the more recent ones like the two last transformers movies for example are'nt there, also i keep having this problem of when netflix is loading it comes up with 'netflix not responding please try again (-9)' so can you please fix that cause its getting on my nerves"
Lately Netflix is putting up VERY OLD FILMS & films I have seen or films that are dubbed into English. It is hard to find something good to watch. I am dropping my rating. They used to be better. Now they are charging more money.
I love Netflix and its the best way to watch t.v (my opinion) but im having so much trouble on my phone with switching profiles i have tried everything even uninstalling and reinstalling the app. On my T.V i can switch the profiles without any trouble so i have no idea why its like this. I would definitely give it a five star if i could have this problem resolved.
Netflix should implement more safety and privacy features. Like the registered master account can have access to all setting and users while other users with different password dont have access on changing account setting and viewing registration details. It has to be done.
In 1 year the price raised 3 times! And Netflix keeps on removing beloved shows that we grew up with. Also pls add the option to remove atoumatic preview overall it's a pretty good streaming app Also if the price raises again ur going to lose a customer.
"Current login security level is very low. As compared to other streaming service, Netflix is very costly and still they are providing very less security to the account. I request them to add a feature OTP based login to make it secure."
Since the Update of Dec 2022 I can't even open Netflix. It is just the logo and black screen. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it 4 times - still can't open it. I can only get Netflix on my mobile phone - this is EXTREMELY frustrating!!!!! PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM!
"The app is good and has lots of shows, movies and series but it doesn't have a lot of new things for instance if you want to see something when you type it up it comes in the search bar but then they don't have it and they get rid of a lot of things so you have to watch them quick"
Very glitchy for requiring authentication when you are already signed in and very slow and prompt. Requires clearing data to get it working again. This has been a bad glitch for quite a while and has not been fixed.
"I have oppo A57, I've subscription of Netflix but it's not getting login on my phone, All of my siblings are using with the same credentials but my app is showing me wrong password. It's been one and a half month to this problem and I'm very frustrated with this. Kindly help me to solve it out."
I'm finding out the prices keep going up it is hard to mention payment but no choice as it's the only bit of TV I get and the main issue is one I used to get put of netflix it will pop up like a little screen so I can carry on watching the issue I have now it still pops up as a little screen but no image just sound and wondering how can I fix this issue
"Don't get me wrong, I love this app. The problem is the fact that there are so many shows that could be added back or added in general (Ex- Young Justice [added back on in addition to season three], Steven Universe, Justice League cartoons and films alike, Harry Potter series) that would most definitely increase the amount of people that watch on the app and make the overall experience more likable. While you most definitely have a wide range of Marvel movies you rarely have a DC selection."
App always works great. It saves my exact spot for every show every time. Unfortunately the selection of available movies is crappy. We only keep this app because of the series selection not the movie selection.
It used to work fine before it started saying app is not installed and I had to go to the play Store to get it enabled even though the app was installed. I have excellent wifi connection and it just shuts down on its own. I don't know what is going on. It was fine a week ago
Why do I find it difficult to sign in after successfully changed password and now it requires to verify my phone number but it keeps saying you have sent a code via text yet am ain't receiving it. It's a persisting challenge for some months now.I am really in doubt whether Netflix help center do existüòû
"To be frank I am a netflix lover but recently I don't know why you are cancelling very good shows like dark crystal,the order, shadow hunters etc. I think you should add an option for people to vote for the renewal for next season. By this u will know how much the audience want to renew. When you cancel a series it feels like pushing us off a cliff and we don't know what happens nextü•∫. Pls consider my suggestion."
"I just gave 3 stars because they got rid of my favorite show, they didn't even show all of the seasons to begin with..and since I can't find all of the seasons in english anywhere it's pretty disapointing. If they reput on the show with *all* the seasons, I would have put 5 stars. Pretty much any ongoing show that's not a 'Netflix Original' seems to barely update, if it updates at all."
"Dear Netflix, The only reasons why I was keeping my subscription was because of series like Gotham, Arrow, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, ect. HBO Max doesn't cover my zone, I was happy about those series being accessible for me on your streaming platform. But now, all those series have come to an end. And you're deleting them progressively. Next year, HBO will cover my zone. We had a good time, but everything has an end."
"For the past two or three days I haven't been able to open Netflix on my phone/mobile. But, I've tried on my laptop and TV and it works just fine. Also, my other streaming apps aren't having this problem either so I just hope this can be fixed soon."
Need an update on Android. No longer able to use the small picture in picture. When I click on the bottom button like I'm going to close the app it usually brings up a small window automatically. After androids update that is no longer possible. Please fix and I'll put it at 5 stars.
"app stopped working after upgrading OS to 9.0 on Samsung S8. I have killed it multiple times, re-logged in but still unable to access any contents on home screen. switching between users not working either. displays can't connect to Netflix even with full network and wifi. ‚òπ‚òπ‚òπ‚òπ"
"My iris recognition sensor error when netflix runs in background I dont know why, but everytime netflix running on background, my iris recognition unlock shows error and won't work. When i clear the app from background, it works again. Its only iris recognition, fingerprint works as usual. My phone is galaxy note FE.."
"Getting more stable with each update. Downloads regularly refuse to play (with an error message) but there are frequent updates and it is improving. When it works, it's great!"
"Bring more asian movies need more, and what with one episode a week can't stand that I forget what I was watching I enjoy watching the whole series , also the subtle are not keeping up with the movie there slow, it runs slow to connect on my tv I don't watch it on my phone but I love Netflix and hope you fix the issues soon"
"Very nice service, large selection of movies, most of them are medium scores, a few are really good. I mostly DON'T like the double standard of having different movies available in different countries. We ALL know that US has the highest collection of movies and they are paying the same price, do you think this is fair?"
"This is a great app!!üòÅ But the problem is when you buy this app with real money and there are still movies that cost real money! It's unfair, we already payed for this app and still need to pay for other movies? I understand netflix that you have to pay for movies but people pay you too, If there are things that can't be understood, Then sorry.. Overall this app is greatüòä‚ù§Ô∏è"
"currently having an issue casting my mobile app to my vizio tv. a google error page comes up. i do not have this issue with hulu or youtube or other casting, so it must be on your end. my netflix account works on other platforms like firestick and computer, so it is just the mobile app."
Although I love this app I can watch my favorite shows on this open I am going to have to say that this app has been the worst for me for so long and eveytime I want to watch a show I get a black screen and it's like a guessing game weather my screen is going to work or not and everytime it doesn't work I just ask myself what is the point of paying for this?? And if anyone see my review please tell me how to work this (I have an Android btw)
"It's very easy to work with my chromecast, and I like watching my shows like everyone else but, I don't want to see the intros. I just want a auto-skip intro/recap settings in the app instead of going back in the app and hit the button. I know that it's a minor inconvenience but intros/recaps are the worst parts of any show"
I also have the same concern to the other user. Put some black background to the subtitle so that it can be readable. It's hard to watch the drama not being able to read the subtitle because the subtitle blended to the background.
I love the netflix movies and I am paying for netflix. BUT I hate the devs. They are constantly removing tv series and movies which is fk frustrating... they are also giving up shows for some weird reasons. If some of my favs went away I will def stop using the platform.
"Netflix is good if your okay with having to wait a year or two for it update its shows. Also the verity of t.v shows is mild. I want more shows like ""My hero academia"" and ""Bungo stray dogs"" wich you have to pirate to get. If it added stuff like that, I know people will be using this app more."
"This app would be perfect if they would finish their series ina timely fassion, I hate having to go online to find the rest of a series when Netflix has only one season there. Also new shows are hard to come by."
"The app is really good, me and my husband were enjoying the app. But The new update is showing error on my phone since last 2 days. N nothing is helping to start Netflix. It's really frustrating. Can you fix it."
"The viewing experience is quite nice, but it takes forever for them to update the shows with recent seasons. Take for example, Brooklyn 99, season 7 has finished airing on TV but Netflix still only has 5 seasons. That's honestly my only criticism, other than that, it's a pretty decent service."
"I just saw the trailer for Locked In, went to the Netflix app, and searched Locked In. It said that you ""don't have that"". But, I looked down at the second row of shows, which is Top Results,and there it was. It was the first title. So, you do ""have that""."
How can I find out if you have content that disappeared from other streaming services? I would be more likely to pay for membership if I could search for content to see if something is available in my region in a language that I speak. It is a lot of money to pay just to get a TV listing. A lot of content disappears on one streaming service to appear on another but there is no way to find out which without a subscription to enable searching.
"I have been using Netflix for a while but, after the new update, I find it difficult to recharge again and after the recharge was done, whenever I try to open it , it says, the server has stop ,try again later. So, Please fix this."
"I wish the language and subtitles were listed with the main description of the movies and TV shows. A LOT of selections seem interesting but I have to open it up and start watching only to find out it is in only a foreign language. TOO MANY Korean, Chinese and Arabic shows! If I pay for a service in an English speaking country, I expect the service to be conducted in English."
"I like netflix. I can watch my favorite anime, and series that I wanted to watch. But I noticed something annoying that always happen for the past few days. The audio continues to play but the screen is freezed."
"I tried opening Netflix just now and it isn't responding at all. After I clicked the Netflix icon the screen stays pitch black. Please fix asap. But before this happened Netflix was just fine, I could watch anything I want."
"Why did you guys remove all the Marvel Movies from the South African version of Netflix? I had all the movies to added to my list, ready to watch them after my exams but I went on Netflix today and just found out that you guys removed all the Marvel movies that were there except Civil War. So I tried updating the app to see if it was a bug or something and when I went back on the app it still wasnt there. Why did you guys remove it ?"
"I really love Netflix but from past 2 3 days im facing the issue of green playback screen but now it's seen continuously looking all abruptly and voices are breaking the video is breaking everywhere please fix it. This is not expected from ""Netflix""."
"like the app and service but this latest update on April 5th made the movie not show up when in screen share mode on our Samsung Galaxy Note 8. The sound will come from the tv, but not the picture. all other applications work properly in screen share just nit Netflix's app. please fix."
"Netflix is a overall great app, but I have some issues with it. The app keeps freezing after I reset the app and my device and it still keeps freezing and sometimes the app won't even work at all, if this can be fixed please do."
"SUBTITLES?! Is there a way to adjust them so they don't blend into a bright picture in the background?? They're illegible with or without eye problems and I'm unlucky enough to endure them with. Jw. With all the anime and Korean flicks, you'd think it would be adjusted if not adjustable."
Love it but hate it. Love Netflix and think they hold some amazing films and series to view. Hate Netflix because we only have access to what they decide to leave on here even though they may have had a film 6 months ago that I want to watch again.
"When I download on Netflix, it doesn't stay for long,I have to redownload again and that's so unfair cos my data subscription is wasting when I have to redownload. I hope you can solve that issue or I'll just uninstall the app and not use again."
"Really nice app, but anytime i click out of netfix to do something else then click back in, it takes me back to the beginning of a show. Its very annoying. I tried to find the ""report a problem"" button but never found one."
"Netflix was nice to have for a while but you kinda get bored of it. Eventually, the shows and movies brought on Netflix got inappropriate and weren't very interesting. Even some of the kids stuff is a bit inappropriate at times but there are somethings that aren't that way thankfully."
"I have to reinstall the app at least twice a day because it only gives you the option for shows with a category selection and movies with a category selection seperated for a few hours then after that movies and shows are mixed in with eachother and it only offers category selections ie: comedy, horror, foriegn, etc..."
The last update put a little bubble that helps you connect it to the Chromecast right on top of the pause/stop button. It used to be in the upper right corner. Now it's really annoying.
"It dont have option to fillter search dual audio movie or hindi dubbed movie. In search option it shows only 12-15 movies. It could b more better if it show the complete list. Example:- If i search for mystery movie, it show same 10-12 movie everytime. Whats meaning of search if it shows only few options."
Hey Netflix developers please add feature for Dual language movies. So that we don't have to click and play any random titles just to see whether it's Dual Audio. At least give some indication (like interactive shows) on tiles of titles for Dual language Titles. Just this request
"Watching in Thailand. Settings all set to English language. However, still getting Thai and other Asian films/series, in menu. Surly, in this day and age, we should be able to sellect the country of origin, for programs we'd like to watch?"
"I really use to like Netflix but EVERY time you come out with a really good Sci-fi/fantasy series, like Cursed for example, YOU CANCEL IT!! Why??? You make no sense. A lot of these series are rated #1, you get us captivated with them then for absolutely no reason at all cancel them. Do you not care about your viewers? The ones paying for service. Your personal feeling about the show should not matter, the ratings should. We should not have to keep being met with repeated disappointment."
I've been subscribing for the past yr and enjoyed watching their movies and series but yesterday there's been a problem that it can't be opened it just say u need to refresh device. I contacted support and I was told that they're having issues with android. This is sad.
"Netflix is average for content, below average for science-fiction flix and too damn expensive for the average-ness all together. However, the rebuffering is minimal as compared to Disney+. Kudos for sorting that."
Everything is top notch and the movies and series in here are also good. But the complain is that they are slowly removing good movies and putting some boring stuff all the good blockbuster movies are removed and the second major problem is the price of their plans which is little costly for those who cannot afford. If they look into these matters they deserve a 5 star no doubt.
"Fix your goddamn bugs , Netflix. Everytime i continue to watch a movie or an episode , the screen turns black, the audio corrupts for some reason, and evertime i close the app, the same problem happens again over and over. It's annoying. Fix it."
i like netflix because it has shows and movies i love on it but netflix keeps adding stuff and then removing them within weeks. it gets annoying. im not gonna have 10 different streaming services just to watch 1 or 2 things. stop removing stuff off of netflix.
"Netflix is a very good app but I rated 3 stars because I can't cast it on TV. The icon for the ""cast on TV"" is no longer there. Other than that it is a very good app. I hope you fix the icon. Thank you."
Remove from row option is not working . No matter how many times I try. They won't go away. How do I fix it?
"It's good and would never go without as it saves being board and watching it on my phone ,but it hasn't the most easiest films or episodes to find, but it brings up stuff totally different to what I'm searching for, plus like it could have the second film or whatever but not have the first, and I've found that in many cases..."
"Hey team, the app was great before two updates, I was able to continue a show from where I left, but now it's messed up, everytime I get back to the app, the resume would be two episodes old from the actual one. Please fix this"
"I simply try to download things and it sends an error at the most random times saying I've been disconnected, yet I'm connected the whole time. But, everything else works very well."
"My main concern now is there's no way to restrict foreground data usage without completely turning off mobile data. My data reset yesterday, and one day later I've burned >80MB watching previously downloaded episodes. No good."
My experience did not allow me access to Classic Care Bears and gave me too much inappropriate stuff and too much content. I wish this service had music too. I unsubscribed and I am disabling this app. Thank you for the shows and movie!
Nice to find shows I like but a lot of the shows are incomplete. Still have to search other websites to watch the rest of some shows even if the series finished years ago. It's iffy on if paying for it is worth it or not.
I have been facing a problem with the app recently.. It only opens once after downloading the app.. Then it crashes and doesn't open again. I've to download it each time I want to open the app.
"Everything is fine with the app, the only and main problem I have is at random times the video quality just drop. Which is really frustrating and there's no way to fix it ‚òπÔ∏è"
Please add option to choose resolution the movie we watch. I have very fast internet connection yet sometimes the apps keep playing low resolution video even though i have set it on the apps to use optimal settings for my screen display. 5* if you make it happen.
"I enjoy the app because I get to see movies and series I like but when it comes to download episodes to watch later without internet connection, it interrupts everytime so I have to be checking every minute and it's annoying"
"It's been great until recently Netflix hasn't been opening. and has been displaying an error message that says to restart my phone. I tried restarting my phone and, uninstalling and reinstalling it and it still wont open."
"As everyone who is reading this would know, there is a lot of content. My issue with NF are the fact that it uses DRM, the geo-restrictions, and that there are quite some weird videos amongst the good library of shows/movies."
"I love using Netflix! You can watch different type of shows and movies.. even eastern Europe shows and movies. However, I can not get Netflix to work onto my phone."
"I'm having trouble signing in on my new phone, when I click open it says to pick a either two saved sign ins, or none of these (which is what I'm trying, to use my new email address) but every time I click on any of them it just closes :( help!"
Netflix app should use white subtitles with black border. While watching some english subbed anime series i was unable to read the subtitles as the white font colour of subtitles was not properly visible in the white background or daylight in videos.
It was a 5 but it just takes off all the good shows and movies. I can't even find good shows and movies all of them are gone and it is so annoying. My favorite shows are gone and I can't watch them again. This is why I'm kind of hating Netflix right now
"Whenever I open the messenger icon, or i slide the notification bar, or even pause it, it doesn't allow me to unpause it. I have to go 10 seconds back and then again 10 forward. Till this is fixed 3 stars only for the amazing content."
After updates quite often breaks cast to devices infact the app doesn't detect any devices when yet other apps have no issues like YouTube and stremio hopefully this gets fixed soon. Netflix itself has been good shame about app and casting issues
"Netflix is great, but the shows I watch freeze, while audio and subtitles continue on. I have to close the app and wait a while until it works again."
"I don't understand what the hell is going on.. the app is fine, but the video is always lagging so slow compared to the audio??on like every device too? My friends have this problem tooüò®"
The parental controls suck! Anyone who has access to your account can change setting you put in place and see parental control code. This app is not parent helpful or safe for children. The features will need to be updated before I will continue using netflix. I will be canceling when my trial is over.
"I enjoy using netflix but there are times that the vid have lighter background color and the subtitles are white, I can't see the subtitles (Anime) I don't see a setting that can fix it. Is there anything I can do about this?"
I am having a problem on galaxy s10e. this problem has also been reported on reddit by users of galaxy s9. hdr content is very dim and cranking the brightness to maximum only helps a little. on the other hand hdr videos on YouTube are bright and colorful and very pleasing to watch. I hope this issue could be fixed in the upcoming update. thank you.
I have been using Netflix for a year now but recently whenever I open Netflix and play something the screen froze and the audio only works it's really annoying but sometimes the app works perfectly !
Please restore the old interface. The new update interface is too clumsy. The old interface is so easy to filter the genres and placement of icons are well organised. Please restore and give update so the users might able to view the catalogue well organized
"it had such good quality and wasnt glitchey at all! Then i shut the app off and tried to go back on it the next day. it wouldnt let me go back on the app it kept saying error. I tried deleting the app and downloading it back, i also tried shuting down my chromebook and turning it back on and nothing was working. if anyone could tell me what to do to fix it then the app would 100% be a five star rating. other then that i love to app."
Love it.. bt it's really annoying when u have to exit from the app.. i hv to reach 'exit Netflix' option which is on the other end of the world.. a back button and a notification tab wud hv done the job..
For some strange reason it doesn't work in my area for most of the time. Just a blank screen keep loading. However it does work good on windows app on laptop.
"perfectly working on my tv, iphone and android. But keeps crashing at the opening on Chromebook, which makes it unusable on that device. Very disappointing."
The latest updates caused the app to be run slower and freeze up. I love Netflix but waiting an hour for it to unfreeze to watch a half hour of TV isn't worth the time.
"My Netflix doesn't sync up with my other devices that have Netflix. I'll be watching a show on my Smart TV and wanna finish on my phone(hours later when I am on lunch at work) and it'll show shows/movies I finished months ago in my 'Continue Watching' I'll stick with my Disney+ and Hulu. Netflix is a joke now. Also, cancelling good shows...like bye."
This was once a great streaming app. And now it is totally overrun with old stuff and foreign films. I'm all for diversity and I think everyone should have thibgs to watch but where the hell is the new stuff that's interesting or even relevant. Just boring if it wasn't for Bridgeton season 2 I'd probably just cancel.
"When i try to watch a movie on my tv using smart view it wont work, the screen is becoming black but the video player buttons are visible. Overall the app is good."
"Netflix is a good app on mobile, but I think its better on TV. on TV it last's longer than mobile because you have to deal with the Wi-Fi more on mobile then TV. This Netflix app is made by the person who created Netflix, Netflix if you can fix your mobile app it's getting very annoying to me, and probably a lot of other people. Also I'm pretty sure people hate the lagging in the app. And by the way why the heck is Naruto on the children's profile. It has violence and blood (I rate it a 3 star."
"I am unable to open the app It shows that we could not reach netflix service, please try again. It shows the error code as (-1001) Please help It happened earlier as well but automatically after 7/10 days it started working"
What I don't like about Netflix is that when you add movies to your list they disappear and more Netflix originals come up and soon you will be paying for only Netflix originals not good at all and if you have movies on your list they should always be there unless you take them off
love the selection but i HATE the new autoplay trailer and preview with sound. it is terrible to have to listen to each and every trailer music when searching thru netflix. there needs to be a disable option for this
"Please improve your android app. I keep receiving device failure error and lose all my offline content, whats worse is that every time this happens it strikes out The number of times a video can be saved offline."
"It's a nice app, but it's expensive and everytime i skip more than once or go farther, it stops and hangs. I hope they fix the long pause when you skip a part"
luv Netflix personally..if u want to binge and just pass a day or a wkend ! Netflix has all u want..only DISLIKE and complaint is why i cant award more stars due to the silly geographic lock in place is ridiculous!! if your selling a product we should all be entitled to the same service across the board ! zort it out and its 5 ‚òÜ but til then ???
"Find it so difficult amd impossible to download on PC, because there's no indication for a button to do that. On mobile it's ok. I rate you very low on this this. Your theater sound is super."
"Just recently ive been watching stranger things and everytime i go to the next episode, the video blacks out like you can only hear the sound and read the subtitles but it video is completely black."
"Cannot share the video to IG stories. Before I could share the film's poster thru the app. Now, when I try sharing it, all I could see was a gradient background. This is important feature to me coz this is the only way where I could share my thoughts abt the film I have watched."
Would make me happier if it always connected to Chromecast instead of being choosey about when it's going to work. Fails to connect more often than not.
"For the past three months, when I pause a movie to return to it later, it restarts.....everytime. I constantly update so I dont understand what the issue is."
I would give it 3 stars because it doesn't have much anime that's talked about a lot for example My Hero Academia it's talked about a lot where I live and when I go on to netflix it's not there so it is harder for me to see the episodes and what actually happens. Please fix this I want to watch it. üôÇüôÇ
There are too many non English shows and movies. That was a recent development and I just hate it. It's not relaxing nor entertainment. This is still America. I'm seriously considering droppings netflix and going to amazon prime. I'm sad because I like netflix technical ease.
I like Netflix. Just dislike the price jumps lately. Hulu has you beat on price for no ads and multiple users as well as content. If prices keep going up I will be cancelling my service unfortunately as others are cancelling theres due to this as well. Thanks.
"The app itself is ok, however why does my Netflix app doesn't have any mirror cast even though I have basic plan. And when I search on Google how to fix this kind of problem they just click the mirror cast that is on the top right corner of their screen in which in my app doesn't have I thought only mobile plan have no screen cast but why my basic plan app doesn't, its unfair that I can't cast Netflix to a big screen"
"My netflix apps has been clashing all the time. Also, the visual from dramas lagged eventho the audio and subtitles are running. Please fix this as soon as possible."
"Great app..smooth and many good movies to choose from...only having issues on downloads, in which some movies/ shows just will not play after 3days on you phone or if you restart your mobile device..im a traveler so i need my downloaded shows dude in an area where there is no cell service..."
"Obviously this is the best streaming app for movies and shows. The only problem I have is that sometimes it will randomly restart my phone while watching things, I highly dislike this so I don't use this app too much. It's happens on this phone a Galaxy J3 and my Galaxy S7"
Very disappointing because there are many movies and tv series in this platform. But many contents varies from country to country. There are content that are available globally but not listed in Netflix. Please fix this platform issue.
Error 5.10 ruins the mobile app. When it happens is completey random and unpredictable. Clearing the Cache and force stopping the app does not repair the issue. It simply resolves it self whenever it decides.
Player keep staying in one place whilst video is playing and when you want to skip a bit forward it brings it back to the start of the video and can't skip at all this happens with many series but please fix your player
"It used to work very well, but now whenever I try to download something, it downloads fully but it looks like I'm viewing the show through an old TV: vague picture and a lot of static."
The app wouldn't load and has been happening for the last few hours. The app stays frozen on the loading screen. I've deleted and installed the app again and the issue hasn't been resolved
"Netflix signed me out on my phone again and i tried logging back in but it continously says that its incorrect even though i know its right because, i use netflix on another device and it was correct. ive had this problem many times before and i thought it was fixed but it happened again this week. How do i fix this?"
"The black screen inbetween the buffering on a smart TV are way too long between the shows you are advertising. I hope that makes sense, but it's quite slow."
"Who's the idiot that came up with the play something button covering up the thumbnails? And why can't I check a box to make it go away? Oh great, the update changed it to a ""surprise me"" box covering up the thumbnails..... Uninstalled. Guess I'll be switching to Amazon prime video."
"The app has been absolutely great since long. But after a recent update, it's just now opening. It's crashing every second. Must be a hitch. Hope so its taken care of soon."
It's great. However I hate the fact of horizontally scrolling titles under each category on narrow mobile screen. Please improve that experience and that would make it even better.
"What's the deal with pic in pic feature? I have it activated in app, but it's not been functioning for weeks"
The app is good for what it is. But it CONSTANTLY hassles me when I leave the app when I'm casting to my chrome cast. Constantly having to open and end the app to have access to the remote menu.
Overall nice but the app gets cranky sometimes. Cast doesn't work most times. Plus the video resolution is not best even when on full speed wifi and best resolution subscription. Just makes me close and watch youtube sometimes.
"Hey amazing folks at Netflix, thanks for the awesome content. I am facing a bug App is getting disconnected from chromecast when put in background, I have already enabled Allow Background Battery usage üôÇ"
"no longer loads after tonights update (28/06) found that going into apps, delete data, then restart device and it works again. would expect better from netflix, especially as the price has gone up again."
"Great Contents but Not Compatible with all notch up phones. I use handset model- Motorola One Power. It is a notch up scrren phone but unlike other phones, if I zoom the video, it doesnit come in Notch up. I would havr given 5 star rating, if you could have made it possible."
I have netflix and i enjoy it but i get aggravated when one of my shows disappear out of nowhere which means that Netflix has erased one my show so now i have to find it on hulu and sit through those stupid commercials but other then that i love netflix whoevers reading this you should most definitely get Netflix
"It's taking too much time to load... Every time I click on something else and tries to go back to the same movie,, the buffering never ends it's not my network problem for sure.. Its the app please fix it"
Normally this app is good but I'm facing serious issues with the subtitles and sound they both are not syncing at all the sound and subtitles are completely different.you need to fix this issue immediately.
"I've had Netflix for a long time, with these new policies put into place it's stupid, if I'm paying for my account what is it their business who I share my account with, they give the choice to have 4 people share the 1 account which is what I paid for, what ever 4 people I choose shouldn't matter, it's what I pay for! Now I don't know about anybody else but if my Netflix becomes interrupted because of their new policies I will find another streaming service that doesn't do that"
"Every since i got my new phone (Galaxy A32) it starts to buffer and play like a stop motion animation and thrn now its starting to shut down and kick me out of the app. Ive also have issues with the window part when you can eatch netflic while on other apps, any and everytime i try to get on snapchat it shuts down reguardless, ive uninstalled the app and restarted it but im still having major issues Ive been using the app for years now and have never had this big of a issue beforr with it"
Everything is great except the payment process. I made a payment through my debit card and ur app stored my card detail. Next month it didn't give me other options of payment. I wanted to continue paying via paytm however it doesn't gv any other option. That's wrong.
Ita a very good app. And I have enjoyed it too much the reason for three star was that I reinstall it and when I open it it shows three account but I clicked on (NONE OF THE ABOVE). It closed than and even I clicked on one of the account but it still closed. Pleas help me solve this problem!
I can't login and some times when I watch friends there are no options on the task bar except for screen lock. And now it says that there is a problem connecting and when you press OK the app exits. Plz fix this problem
"I used to love Netflix......but over past few years they been dropping all the good grade A movies for B-Movies......and a lot of foreign stuff added now. Along with this, NETFLIX still can't make their app optimized for tablets! What gives guys? Please, start putting the good stuff back up. I hate Hulu but if I have to I will."
"I really love Netflix but I am disapointed and very anoyed to hear that Harry Potter will not be available to UK Netflix users but yet it will be available for Netflix users in France, its totally unfair, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE can Netflix bring Harry Potter to Netflix for UK users. Also can you make the Minecraft compatible for other devices like Samsung phones and TVs as my phone amd my vergin TV are currently not compatible for this. Please reply"
Is it really necessary that Netflix automatically connects to the TV when you open the app up really all I wanna do is look at the selection not interrupt what's already playing on my tv.
Good app except it doesn't give me any info on what the movie or TV show is about. Unless I know the movie/show it's a bit like a lucky dip. Little bit frustrating that this has disappeared as it was on there originally.
"This app is really nice and amazing, but the only problem is that there are many anime series which aren't available in dub for example Gintama it was realeased in 2006 and the dub version was realeased in 2017 but this app still doesn't have the dub version. That's all I think so."
"It's a great apo if you want to watch the shows and movies that are on it alreafy. However, many of the good shows such as Wolfblood or Pretty Little Liars have been taken off, making Netflix very annoying and boring."
I think the app works really well however it continuously opens up in my background even though the data for this is shut off and uses up up to 26% of my battery within 1 hour I actually have it on a watchlist to watch how much of my battery it is killing. Netflix is number one battery killer in my phone followed by messenger and Facebook but even messenger only goes 12%. If you can find it away that this will stop killing my 5100 milliamp battery so fast I would give it 5 stars.before I installed this app on my phone I would only have to charge it once every 3 days now I have to charge it twice a day.
All the downloaded movies on my laptop suddenly vanished. I couldn't find it and i don't what happened. When i go online and try to search the movie i need to download it again. I don't have regular internet connection though that's why once i have connection i download all the movies i want to watch offline.
Its awesome but when i install it to my android tv...navigation by remote will not work.. unless you use a mouse....i think the app is only for touch screen devices and not for smart tv... i hope they make a compatible app for android tv ....
been experiencing playback specs issues with realme device switching from L1 to L3. this is not a device issue since i can fix it after some troubleshooting. but it's very annoying to have to do it alll the time. fix the bug
Giving this 3 stars because I hate the fact that they pile everything that I have watched and not allowing me to hide it even when I have dropped the series or no longer interested. Now watching list is now a mess and I wish they'll allow us to remove it or give us an option to tell them we are no longer interested with the series or movie.
"Definitely need more movies. Seems like most of the shows that interest me are not available. Example. Superman, Seinfeld, Aquaman, etc, etc. I don't care about series. Then you have to dedicate time for this. You have to watch in order etc. I'm a 52 yo white male so I'm obviously not your market"
Please this is very important please mind this. I've been watching Netflix in my aunt's house using her account and I really liked it and I want my own account so I can watch whenever I want. But in the payment method the only available option for sim users is postpaid. Please add a prepaid option for sim users. Btw I'm using Globe Telecom billing options.
"Netflix, oh, Netflix, please do something about your subtitles, don't let them hurt my eyes even further, please let me understand your content without getting my eyes curl. Maybe check what Viu does with their subtitles, the options they provide us for their subtitles, for your reference. Please, Netflix, please, for the love of God, please.."
"Netflix is a good streaming and downloading movie though but what hurts most is that some of us paying into it is to get to watch some movies but we find it unfortunately that we won't see the movie we dying to watch, it's just that you left us with no choice but to watch the movie you dropped and it's not fine there are some movies I'm trying to get on it and I can't get to find it and yet you guys you won't do something about the movies that are been demanded for...."
Video quality is poor. The video artifacts makes my viewing experience not enjoyable. Fix this Issue. 3 stars for the app and its interface. Will gladly change to a 5 when the video artifacting issue is fixed.
"i gave 3 stars i didn't give rest of the 2 stars because sir i want you to tell us about a movie briefly when we click on the icon of movie then we want to know about movie before we start watching any movie. tell us about genres and audio languages, as amazon prime video app shows, don't mind sir or madam beacuse I'm comprising your app with other app. actually i know very well your app is more better then amazon from all other sides but they tell us about movie better then you. please fix it."
please add the rest of the series like Brooklynn 99 and jane the virgin ... it sucks when we are fully on a series and we can not finish it ... and also when I heard about Netflix I thought you were great but you become zero ... too cruel lack of news that is not necessarily films of this year but there are Indian films and others that have exploded the box office that we do not even ... always the same comedies nothing new ... update Netflix seriously it deserves another type of perfume.
It does the job and yes u get games but Why the f# isnt vertical mode a feature? I mean not even on 90s Batman??!???
The app is great but some tv shows are not available in my country fix that.
"What's the point of putting a show up that starts at season 10ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è people want to watch from season 1, not start over half way through."
"Okay so some people on netflix really love the show pokemon, however you have 4 series on there and theres 3 problems, if you can have indigo leauge thats 19 yrs old and not newer ones well a bit old, like diamond and pearl like those uhm, second if i try to find diamond and pearl anywhere its japanese and i cant find the whole series, thrid why have sun and moon but not ultra adventures, cant you delete indigo? or something to fit more series? overall i give 3 stars, other then that, great app!"
"Mostly old films , webseries, dramas, from Holywood, Bollywood, unloaded."
"I really want Netflix to have actual movies such as rated R horror and comedies. You guys took off American dad, family guy, saw, hostile, and many other films and TV shows I love. This is not what I'm paying for. I binge watch breaking bad constantly which is one of the few reasons I still even have Netflix. The whole point of this review is to inform you that many people and me, would enjoy Netflix more if we were provided with rated R features that we love. If we don't have that, then we're just wasting our money."
The shows/movies that I've already watched are not being updated by this stupid app. I have to go back to that particular episode and bring the red line to the end so that it gets updated. Pathetic!! Fix this error ASAP!!
"Would be a whole lot better if it stopped automatically messing up my brightness every time I went to stream something, or auto playing adds,or auto playing something when I click it because I'm interested in it because don't want to start a new show on season 2"
I have to keep turning OFF subtitles every time I watch a movie. So annoying
I enjoy Netflix till I start getting some problem that it cuts out when u watch something. Which it has never happened before plz sorted it out .its really not fair to be paying money for this to be happening.
"Please Add Yoruba language in Audio. For some Nollywood movies that's come with English language, so it will be helpful for some people who can't understand English. Hope you do so. Thanks"
"Why some of the anime don't have english subtitles, it only have chinese subtitles?. I hope you can do update it with english subtitles thank you."
"Subtitles on at start of everything. Also, keeps stopping every 20 mins or so and then reverting back to app. Then Subtitles come on again!!!! Driving us mad."
The shows and movies qre decent still kinda pissed they removed most the power rangers but the biggest problem I have is when on netflix on my tv because there is no way to take shows off continue to watch without deleting the profile and it wont even go away if you give it a thumbs down so netflix give me back all the power rangers and allow tvs to remove shows from continue to watch list without deleting the profile and you've got yourself a five stars
"Everytime I scroll down my list and open a movie or show to read the details I am thrown back to the start of my list. Also, another thing that must be added in the details is the language in which a particular movie or show is available."
"Netflix need to have catalogue mechanism to find the available movies. Search has to be improved by adding filters to find movie by year,cast or language. recommendation algorithm is really poor."
I already have an account and after signing in it is asking me for payment. Does it need an update or what..The experience on netflix has been a bit inept lately. I hope you fix these bugs soon.
"It's nice to see new shows and movies on this. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's not the Netflix app it's the price of it. I want people to know that it's gets expensive after awhile. From $6.99 to $19.99 very easy sometimes. So please be aware of this."
"Movies and TV shows, the video slows down almost like slow mo not matching up to people's mouths. If I tap screen stops for a minute but than goes back to slow mo. I'm using a Samsung galaxy a32 5g. I just Uninstalled testing to see if reinstalling fixes anything."
"Netflix is fun and exciting but sometimes it is super super frustrating. Cancelling shows that are so we'll loved.For ex.Netflix cancelled Anne with an E for s4 the best show that I have ever watched and that's saying something+it is connectable me myself is a redhead and I feel just like the Anne does sometimes.Seeing her life in a interesting+fun perspectives.That is why Netflix shouldn't cancel Anne with an E.Please reconsider,this show is changing my life.Also Gilmore Girls needs to continue"
Having to uninstall and reinstall when I get that maturity rating error is getting old.
"Add Urdu subtitles, All type of subtitles are available only Urdu is missing so please add Urdu subtitles so we can watch other languages movie easily"
Its a good app.But when it comes to subscription they could given a yearly subscription in mobiles too like amazon prime and disney+ hotstar. So that users of netflix will gradually increase than the other too. Its a request from my side to provide yearly subscription in mobiles.
"I seen to have a problem on mobile with the subtitles. I have them off but they won't go away. Especially when watching for example ""The Kingdom"" subtitles are already provided for the Saudi spoken language but Netflix thinks I have subtitles on so there are stacks of words on top of each other blocking the screen lol. Any fix?"
"I give 5 if you fix your video quality problem.. Its so disgusting. My wifi speed is good,, and also in my laptop, videos play in hd quality, But when its comes to my phone video quality goes down automatically.. So can you guyz fixed this, Or add a option like YouTube where i can choose the qualityüôÇ"
"Netflix has been showing some annoying problem since the last update.. As I'm fast forwarding in some scenes, the scenes got stuck up for some seconds. Please fix it asap"
Phone version still hangs and gives error... Movie continues to play but the screen is lagging audio is good but visuals no... I'm wondering why this is happening to the phone version but not with the tablet...
Suddenly my Netflix has stop working . The app doesnot get open ... What should i do now that the beta programme is full. I still need an access to netflix as i have already paid for this month and my netflix doesnt open at all since a week now.....please tell me what needs to be done!
Downloading is super finicky. Sometimes it works but even the slightest change causes them to freeze (stops progressing the download). The streaming is constant though
"Was great until the latest update, i mostly watch the show with my friend on call but with recent update when on call when i pause the show it does not play again i have to restart the show. Please fix this. Otherwise it is very user friendly."
I would have given 5 stars but whenever I watch one one particular device the audio plays but the image ceases and have to keep reloading the movie or episode I am watching. other than that Netflix is awesome
"Lots of improvements over the years. Still get frustrating notifications such as ""Widget refresh on progress ..."" that I can't get rid of and had to restart my phone."
"the player should be improved, by moving the movie forward and backwards with double tapping on the screen. the movies name should as it is (not translated or translation between () ) movie rating should there the category of each movie should be there in description"
"Great streaming service, but every now and then it'll stop working, like every time I try to open it, it closes instantly, but a way to fix it is by uninstalling it and reinstalling, and every month or few, they raise the prices, but other than that, good app."
"Not so great, on the one hand the app has amaizing and a huge number of movies and shows but the amount of data charges are through the roof... Since the last update one episode of any show can burn about 600mb of data and that's on Low Quality settings."
Love using this app when I'm wanting to watch some of my favorite animes. One issues I have is that I cant seem to download episodes anymore. I'm using wifi and it just stays on 0%. I have plenty of memory on my phone so I don't know what's wrong.
After the update of 24 OCT 2022 The app does not open at all stuck at Netflix logo at startup reinstalling the app but does not fix it. Otherwise the UI is good the content is also super
"I am annoyed because it keep saying that it has trouble playing the video and all of my downloads are like that, the grey's anatomy is my favorite show and I can't download it whenever I want because it's a limited download but I had to uninstall the app several times so my downloads will work, I already try searching for help but none of it is effective. I love it at first because it's efficient and easy to download what dramas I wanna watch but this has been my problem these days. Fix it pls."
App stopped working on Android tablet after recent update. It would not play any video. Had to uninstall and reinstall to get working. Sharing here for the benefit of others.
Would give it 5 stars however keeps randomly losing video and showing black screen with sound. Oddly i can see the picture when i go to task view but not in full screen. Tried closing app but still occurs until i reset the phone. This is on Huawei P20 Pro
"Movies r good.. customer support rude. Tried calling them twice, both times communicated in English only. Myself prefer Hindi dubbed movies and communication in Hindi. However, the support team sound like please read our FAQ and sent list for causes. Another time sound rude. Had issues while telling why do i love k drama. None of their business. The movies and shows need to be refreshed one. That's it. I basicaly subscribed for Lucifer and now k drama and Japanese animation."
Glitchy. I try to watch stranger things. Sometime it'll steam without issues. Other times it will reset my whole phone. Wish it would stop. I'd love to be able to finish the series.
"Netflix is a entertaining app.. It has a lots of stuff to watch which is fascinating from movies to drama, hollywood to korean everything is available.. bUT the sad part is it does not have some marvelous movies, series and stuff.. But anyways its wonderful looking forward to it‚ò∫"
Last update messed up the app on my phone. Continue watching is gone as well as other things.
"It's a good app with Best content, though it doesn't listen fully Don't have category for 'Hindi dubbed best movies. checking the language of a movie is difficult. Specially when Netflix do so good dubbing."
App keep turning itself back on even when I Force Stop it. Going to uninstall it if it keeps doing that. Don't need optional apps running in the background and draining my battery. I'd rather go without.!!!
"Tbh.., being cliche.. it's a good app but again as every app it is not perfect for every feature.. as from now on in my opinion personally,.. i don't have any sort of problems that kind of mess up netflix.. i'm just using it to watch entertainment."
Same quality shows/movies. But since the June update I can no longer cast from my phone to my TV. Other streaming apps are still able to connect so it must be a Netflix exclusive issue.
What is happening??! My s s10 plus showing as widevine l3 on app.reinstalled at now it shows as widevine l1 and supports full hd playback.But after playing a movie for 1 min the video pauses but audio plays in background!!!!.what happened to this app.so glitchy!!
"It's a good app, I can watch movies and series without any problems but they keep deleting movies and series and don't have many movies I want to watch eg saw 1 and saw 2 or the original scream, coraline, if they could stop deleting them and add more then I would really appreciate it"
"Netflix is brilliant but I'm unable to watch a lot of movies on my fone, I can hear it, see the subtitles but not the movie, screen is blank. I don't have this problem on my tablet. Do I need to download something ? It's very annoying"
The app keps cutting out of whatever I'm watching and returning to the home screen. Why do the subtitles automatically appear at the beginning of every show/film now?! Updates needed.
I've been searching some of my favourite all time movies but it doesn't show up :/ For example when I search up bayonetta bloody fate it doesn't show anything yet when I searched it in google it showed that it indeed has it but in the app form it doesn't have it.
it's getting too expensive and there's barely anything good anymore. also if you're gonna have only one/two movies in a series then what's the point. gets on my nerves. but heartstopper is really good a like that
"Keeps crashing today, every few minutes its back to the home screen. I have updated everything. Cleared cache on everything but the app still force closes back to homescreen. Its really annoying now. Are there any update bugs Netflix?"
"When I search for ""audio in (language)"", it shows a bunch of titles, none of which have audio or subtitles in the language specified. Otherwise, a decent app."
"The app is exellent except one major thing, I have an Amoled Screen thats capable of HDR and 1080p but everytime i watch something on Netflix the quality only stops at 480p/ SD quality and doesn't go any higher ."
So today Oct 19 I keep getting adds me and my mom pays for Netflix so why are there adds please fix this. And it's only on the phone. I can't stand adds. Please fix this but I love the shows and movies. Oh and after a few seconds of whaching a show I'm kicked back to home.
"French Canadian here. Why is it so hard for Netflix to list languages *before* playing?!? Oh, yes, you do have language settings, but they're being _ignored_. Case in point. Very first title listed under Action & Adventure: Monster Hunter. No details on languages, so I press play. Default is English; my settings only allow French. So I look at the options. Turns out Hindi, Tamil, Polish are avail., but not French, not even subtitles. Why the hell suggest movies not even offered in my language???"
Would be a better rating if the app did not try to populate all my screens with the Netflix icon. Why in the world would you think I need 15 (would be more but screens are full) icons to Netflix? I delete them and each time I power up the phone another one is added? Please fix this.
Ok Netflix I get it but really I'm sick of trying to find a good movie then to find out I gotta read while I watch cause it's in a different language. Can u stop putting them kinda movies on an maybe put more English movies on please and please can u try to put better English horror movies on for October please!!! That be awesome if u did
"Used to be five stars, although bad decisions have ruined it for me. First of all, for no reason, only 27 episodes of the third season of Pok√©mon Sun and Moon are on here, instead of the full third season. Second of all, the new Pok√©mon series, which was meant to be a netflix exclusive, is only on American Netflix, which made me very upset, as I had been waiting all month for the first few episodes of the new series. The best idea I had is to merge Canadian and American netflix."
"Lately whatever I'm watching, after so much time, starts coming in blurry. I have to keep exiting and restarting, then a number times I have to jump ahead to where I actually watched it."
"Search function is limited. There should be a larger library with Icons for movies and shows by genre, Nationality, etc. When searching in this manner now only a dozen or so films and TV shows per category are listed. Very poor compared to other Aps of this type."
REALLY NETFLIX IS VERY ONE OF THE MOST ENTERTAINING OTT PLATFORM.... Really the web series and movies are awesome....but I am giving 3 star because of payment methods...there should be wallet option ...incase if the person do not have any credit or debit card they can easily purchase with the domestic wallet option .... So plz team you are requested to put some more payment methods...
It stopped working. I cannot watch a show I watched yesterday. Only on mobile though.
"It was really amazing pictures,and good quality films that we had."
"I really do not like this new update, sometimes i will want to open another application and do some other things, but my movie usually starts playing under the background even after pausing it...it doesnt work for movies that has different language."
Recently I'm getting an issue with pause and play. Once I paused my video and get back to it after some time it won't play that video where i left..it's again starts from beginning Pls review this ASAP and resolve this serious issue ...It's wasting our time
Please Fix My List. When you add a movie or series into my list it doesn't show up on my list platform it's so getting annoying when you have to search the particular series now and then repeatedly.
The ads are annoying there's seventy four seconds long and On a t v netflix doesn't give ads
"A lot of my favourite series and movies cannot be accessed due to my country. Already requested, but still there are no difference. Already contact the costumer service, not much help, really."
The app is not longer registering the place even if I make sure to press the back to menu button. It's also needing work to not skip ahead to the most recent season. If I finish season 1 I want to watch season 2 not season 8. Gratitude.
"The reason why I am very upset with Netflix is because they are deleting tons of animes that I love and rewatch over and over again. It makes me sad to see that they are deleting them off of netflix. But im really hoping you guys will add more, but other than that Netflix is good for many other reasons."
"Love Netflix no doubt, but this app is a bit of a mess, sometimes it doesn't show image previews of the shows/movies and also it sometimes goes back to the main menu while I'm watching something. üòí"
I just subscribe this app...but why the icon chromecast never show come at my app? I already follow all the instruction shown at netflix help center but it doesn't sloved my problem Im using android phone Oppo F1s..last time I used it this netflix during trial. The icon is shown but now Im starting paid it won't show anymore...help me please tq
"i love netflix as a service, but lately the phone app is not working - won't play videos etc. i followed the instructions and both deleted and reinstalled the app, restarted my phone and it keeps happening!"
Frustrating I can't join Netflix because they keep stopping at the last part of my sign up
"Overall its great and everything, however I strongly recommend that you add in more seasons to spongebob. Since spongebob is so widely known and liked within society it would make audiences such as me and many others grateful. By doing so, Netflix will increase the amount of spongebob fans and this can lead to further success within your business etc. I hope Netflix takes this into deep consideration and will follow my request. Thank your for your time."
I love the the streaming but there is no new content.... It feels like its the Yahoo of strwaming
"I hope i can have my own customization in the video player. I just dont want to rewind 30 seconds, i want it to be 10 like the desktop version and there is no skip intro? I hope i can change the rewind second to 10 or smthng."
i think that netflix is a very good app to watch movies and just chill but it kinda sucks that you cant erase things from your continue watching list. What if you accedently clicked on something you didnt like and wanted to delete it?? ill give you a 3 star.
"Netflix is a really good app! But...it doesn't have ANY Disney movies, pixar,not very much marvel AT ALL and it usually has the second movie, but doesn't have the original!"
"Since the past couple updates, if I watch multiple episodes of a show and then leave the app, when I come back it resets back to where it was. Tired of having to figure out what episode and time of show I was on. Please fix this!"
Good app with huge annoying starting tune which wakes up everyone in the house. No settings to turn it off. I will give it 5 stars only if Netflix do something about that annoying starting sound.
"I gave this app three Stars because it doesn't want to open , it was working so good and i like it , but it suddenly stopped working , i can't sign in the only thing i can see is the netflix logo and a black screen . I hope they fix this soon before my payment ends."
I give Netflix a three star rating as yes it's a good streaming service to have to watch movies and TV shows on but I just wish they would keep update with the seasons of shows like for example the TV show S.W.A.T with Shemar Moore is already in Season 6 but Netflix is up to only Season 5. Like why have the show on here but not all the seasons completely there just like NCIS as well as these are my two favorite shows that I'm starting to binge watch.
This app is very good but some time videos and movie not play properly they play for just 1 min and the back automatically plzz fix this problem bay the. Way Netflix is best platform for entertainment
the app is great my cousin and I have been using it for years until I uninstalled it because it crashed and crashed so when I downloaded it again I go to the sign in button i put the correct email and correct password but it says the password is incorrect please tell me how to fix it
"this app is very buggy, I already installed - uninstalled 2 times this week (even after the update) very dissapointing, took a lot of time to load the movie too. need more movie/series thats not netflix productions"
"Netflix should let the user to change their video size/ quality during streaming manually, because Netflix so slow to load, sometimes the video quality change to the lowest...and no, there's not a problem with my internet connection"
Now Netflix become so worst i have getting so much problem in downloading. I use 149 plan and i used it only but still it's shows u can't download to many video's in my download when i just have 20 download. Im very disappointed please work on this because Google show in Netflix we can download 100 tittles.
One thing i hate about netflix is that we have to watch by using our mobile data which is not fair because firstly we pays monthly for the netflix but to watch anything we have to use our mobile data pack. Please make it offline just like the cables
"So so experience with this app, sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. Occasionally it'll not play somethings that are downloaded. Right now it's refusing to even open which is really annoying when you're mid series."
"I am really disappointed by the ""are you still there"" happening after only 3 episodes. I miss the unlimited continuous episodes. I guess I'll have to go back to watching Amazon Prime because at least they play 6 episodes or Tubi that has continuous play. I'm so sad."
I love Netflix like I use it everyday but I've tried the American version to see the difference and they have alot more shows then UK one my favourite show was supposed to have 4 seasons on the UK one but it only has 2 and on the American one they have the full 4 seasons and so many other good shows I've been looking for on Netflix and definitely alot more seasons then here. We need more showssssüò≠üò≠
I'd have given it a five star but it's not right that they collect the subscription money from my account without asking. if you've already restricted me from watching cause I didn't pay why then collect the money from my bank after some time?? You've restricted me from watching u shouldn't subscribe for me without asking. You guys need to fix this cause it's not nice getting debited like that.
"The app is great and all, but why is it when I try to watch an episode, my phone suddenly freezes, crashes, and then restarts? This isn't the first time this happened though. My phone is a Galaxy A31 by the way. Please fix this."
"I think that Netflix is a great way to watch movies and some good documentaries, and crime shows like first 48,cold case files. But it should be cheaper or free now that would be so cool. From Chicago."
"My bluetooth phone has a delay, could you make a feature to syncronize it? I mean, a thing on settings where we can set a time to adjust video audio according to us? it is a big Company, it's weird it does t have it"
"Recent updates make the app crash and the downloading. of episodes is horrid. It now takes multiple restarts of the app for it to download episodes. It used to be smooth, now it's bothersome."
"Was great when first came out you could search anything. Any movie, but now shows are always being taken off, and it's the same things. Very tiny limited searches and half of what's on Netflix you get free on Tubi"
Won't open. I downloaded and deleted this app but it still won't open up for me even just to sign in. I'm not sure what the problem is. On any of my other phones in the past the app has been great
"PLEASE FIX THE BLUE LIGHT FILTER OVER RIDE WITHIN APP. Every now and then my blue light filter turns off when I start watching a new episode or movie, EVEN WHEN MY SETTINGS SAY ITS ON. AND I HAVE MY VIDEO ENHANCER SETTING TURNED OFF. MY PHONE SAYS THE FILTER IS STILL ON BUT IT CAN CLEARLY BE SEEN ITS NOT ON WHEN PLAYING BACK. PLEASE FIX THIS. IT'S REALLY FICKLE AND ANNOYING."
"I recently upgraded my phone to android 9.0 and since then, Netflix has issues. There are several errors it shows. The help section at the website didn't help at all."
"So it was a five out of five star rating from me but the app is just stopped working for me now , now everytime I click on it to open the app it just stays on the starting screen where its black background with the red netflix sign and I can't get on it, I don't know what to do ? Somone help me please I wanna watch my series üò≠"
"I love Netflix, but, recently when I try to download videos it just wouldn't download even on 50mbps, this us just too irritating. I tried to heck with other apps, they're just downloading fine, idk what wrong with Netflix, is there any solution for this?"
I really love this app but their is just one bug the bug is that anytime I finish watching a one piece anime episode and I check how much episodes I watched and it says I haven't watched the episode please Netflix fix this bug and if you don't I will still love Netflix
"My App is updated but i still dnt have the same options as when i open it on my TV, also comparing the tv App to my friends tv App i dnt have the same selections of movies. Other then that this App is a 5 star one."
"Dear Netflix Owners, I would like for you to add more kinds of animes since there isn't much I could watch, i would be grateful for that if you add more animes , like the animes that are popular and trending right now. I just couldn't rewatch the same animes, it would be very boring seeing the same animes and taking a long time to put more animes which suck. So as I say this whole paragraph, I would love for you Netflix to add more animes please. Sincerely, A google play reviewer"
It's a best app to watch anime and movie but please fix problem I can't watch Naruto shipuden in English please then I will give 5 stars ü§©
Play with my money all you want Netflix should be free but in movies I like it did not give 5 stars because of payment
"I love netflix, it has great shows and movies to watch, and even Netflix originals. I would rate it a 5 star but they are starting to take down Disney movies... and that's disappointing. My favorite movie Moana is now gone....and others üòñ love Netflix but, please bring back more disney movies!üòí"
All is well. I wish this app would save my search history. It's annoying to type my fav show or movie names every time. An opportunity for the UI to be better.
"The only problem I have with Netflix is that stupid, irritating, disgusting notice ""Are you still watching?"" Every single hour, without fail, I have to stop what I'm doing, go into Netflix and push the stupid button. I am honestly ready to discontinue use and go with Hulu."
"It's good. Netflix has varieties of movies that I like, but why are you taking them away? I received the alert that I could enjoy 'About time' in Netflix, so I came back to watch it a few days after, and it disappeared!"
"Technically the application itself is not bad. I don't like that they limit available content based on my current physical location! (yes I know... License blah blah blah...) I should get the same content if I pay the same money! . It's also very annoying that the app pauses streaming every 2 hours asking user ""are you still watching?""."
Annoyed with the brightness control! If I let my son watch a movie he blinds himself because it's where he holds the phone. I get blinded by max brightness and I'm really annoyed with it. Can't find a way to remove it. I'd go as far as to say I HATE IT! Otherwise the app really fits my needs.
"It all started well until one day it wouldn't let me download Friends and claimed that I didn't have enough space even though my downloads were completely empty, I've deleted all my downloads, restarted my phone, reinstalled the app all multiple times and its progressively getting worse to the point of not allowing me to even access the app and when I eventually seldom do, it doesn't want to play anything in my downloads it says the video has a problem!"
"no new movies and the updates dont work on my device so. I cant download any movies or watch some movies or shows e.g black mirror bandersnatch. Please fix this and make the updates for androids and tablets because without the updated one it is causing problems and I cant enjoy the app. Please fix this, thank u"
Netflix often forgets my video progress and sometimes downloaded videos automatically becomes unavailable and asks to download again. I had very bad experience using latest versions fix this Netflix Asap!
The app is good over all. The only issue I have is the download speed for downloading. It's very slow and it shouldn't take 30 min to download 200 mb I can download the same file else where in about 2-3 minutes. Please fix this if possible
They keep taking out all the great shows.... I honestly might cancel my subscription with Netflix. They keep blocking the good shows from USA. Unacceptable. I'd rather pay someone else who have the shows that I like.
Netflix is great but one thing wrong when you pause the what you watching it won't let you push play . You hit too back up or go forward 10sec. What's up with that
"My infinix note 30 is having an issue with this app, the app opens and trailers play but once I want to play the actual episodes it just keeps loading without playing anything and I've not been able to watch anything so far, please help find a solution to this"
"Hey guys, stop being like TikTok and start being like Netflix. It sucks to see that the ""games"" and especially the ""fast laughs"" almost replace the actual service. Obviously I'm not cancelling it because there's some great stuff on there and it's way easier now to have streaming sites like this. But sometimes (and I feel like more often than sometimes) you make shows starring only TikTok stars or whatever you think young people will like (exhibit a: he's all that)."
You need to fix second step authentication for making payments. The experience is pretty terrible and annoying. The page tends to recent when you try to enter the OTP. Will wonder how the experience team hasn't picked this up.
Good app.... Would recommend adding a laptop as a means of watching in the basic plan
"Works great while in active use, but drains my battery when idle. I cannot keep it installed for that reason. I'm on Android 6 (Marshmallow), and this appears to be a pretty common bug there."
"Hi Netflix team, I have been wondering for a long time why Netflix does not have a 30 seconds forward option. Only has 30 secs rewind... Could you please add 30 secs forwarding and update the app."
One of the top movie apps. Always room for improvement. I love that they have MSNBC's Lockup. I would give Netflix 5 stars if they could get every episode instead of just bits and pieces.
"Netflix should be made free, like YouTube. Then more people will be able to binge watch, which will be worthy. All the Netflix series' should be made available on YouTube. And Netfix should enable the option of downloading series in gallery too."
I've been pretty happy with Netflix for quite a while now but recently I'm having problems on my phone it can't find the app where it can't open it up I don't know why all I can see is the users that are on there and nothing else is having problem connecting
"Whenever I watch a show and I click on the screen to make everything to go away, the brightness only goes, and everything stays there, which means I have to wait for it to disappear, which sucks."
The app lags a lot. And also the genre of the content is not self explanatory . The genre of the content should be displayed so that it will be easy for the viewers to choose from.
"Video player doesn't work on my phone sometimes, there's the audio but the screen is black, have to refresh the app a few times before it works again, please fix this bug"
For some reason it erased everything I was watching and then it says it doesn't have it but I go to another family members profile and the show if there!!!
All good but why the video player doesn't have video quality select option????
"Can't play series or movies over the phone call, earlier version was better."
Sheeking menu during video displayed for a very long duration.üòüüòü
"febuary 2024 update : my xperia 1 iii suppose to play 21:9 aspect ratio perfectly, now it is streched, and i checked that widevine goes to L3?"
"i love this app sm, works without any bugs and all's good. BUT WHY DO YA'LL KEEP REMOVING ALL THE GOOD THINGS?! They removed Mean Girls, The Vampire Diaries, I think they removed Titanic too. What's next bro? Are ya'll gonna remove eveything?"
Not happy the only thing I got Netflix for was to watch the walking dead and it's not eithen there to watch so not happy
This new update we cannot watch the movies while we are on call please fix this
It would be super cool if your app would stop making my phone crash
U watch movies in segments it takes to long to watch 1 movie very disappointed
Video quality is soo poor. Even I downloaded HD content. Disappointed üò°
Thi app is quite good but whenever I want to search movie it don't have it so please add movies
"App works great most of the time... but just today started having issues where the screen doesn't flip sideways to play a movie... closing the app and reopening makes no difference... I primarily watch on my phone, will this bug get fixed soon?"
The experience is good. But you take this 3 stars because the subtitles in some movies are out of sync and there is no way to fix it. Please fix the problem and you will get 5.
Today I had an issue while watching movies the video get lagged and green scratched video lag is coming what could I do.......
in so fustrated my Netflix would not come in and wont switch accounts for my family i know my data and WiFi is fine because everything else works fine and they took my money i had to cancel my whole account to get my refund üò† and they told me that if i reconnect in 10 days i can have all my stuff back but the app is still not working ugh my kids are upset my friends and i can't have our movie nights and im going to loose everything if it ever gets fixed.
"Been disappointed lately at the show cancelations and price raise. Since when did netflix become the nazis of streaming services? Anyway, I still use it for select shows that I can't find anywhere else. Hopefully they stop being so greedy and start looking at what their costumers want and what other streaming services are begining to offer. Or it will probably be their downfall."
When watching a show/movie the subtitles are often displayed at the top of the screen and not at the bottom. This is annoying as it covers up faces.
Really like Netflix. Great app but one thing I would say about it is that you can't search for a movie that you know of. Tried finding a movie to watch in the search engine but came out with nothing that I wanted to watch.
lately the app freezes up everytime I download various series or movies. so i can save on data. when I open the app again they have erased all my downloads. it's just frustrating and I'm just wasting time
"Downloads I have the full package for 4 devices, but recently two of the phones can only download 3 episodes at a time and it shows downloads full. I cleared all devices and reset but still doing the same thing."
Wouldnt be a too bad if it didnt auto play or automatically play a movie for me that i didnt even choose. I like to pick what i am watching if am paying for it. Cant find the option to turn it off in the settings.
"I really love this app but the only two things that suck is that you guys remove good anime shows and dont even put all the series. For example Naruto, its rally good but it would be better if you guys added Boruto and theother series. Same thing for other anime series like Attack on Titan ( which you guys removed:/), Hunter x Hunter, The promised Neverland, etc. Please look in to this and remove shows that no one even watches please adn Thank you."
"It is okay, but I have to get the free app in youtube but it no longer work in youtube but the password is right but only problem is that YouTube Netflix can't let me watch the popular film called ""Merlin' because I watch TV and other devices but it's telling me to download the Netflix on play store but I need to watch teen cartons but I did my best to try watch Netflix still something Is wrong because still I couldn't let me watch but I tried to download but no internet connection. It's Ok 3/5‚≠ê"
"The app is good, but there's a glitch. After paying the subscription for 30 days, it still shows to update payment. Instead of 30 days, I am only able to use my subscription for 20 days & then my account is on hold."
"It works. Subtitle setup should be inside app, not at web site. Dashboard is changing with no logical reason. Sometimes are started series in front, sometimes are in a middle - thats definetely wrong but I am not common behavior person - its more oriented for other common sheeps"
"I've been having so much trouble watching my shows because it kicks me out of the app every. single. time. It's so annoying. When I want to resume what I was watching, it will restart the whole thing!"
"I had a great experience until yesterday. No matter how low I put my brightness setting on my phone, playing Netflix always put the show on the highest brightness possible. Please fix."
Why do I have to turn off close caption every time I log in all of sudden? It's very irritating
"Netflix works wonderfully on the xbox one, HOWEVER everytime I try to login on my phone, I can't get past the ""30 day free trial,"" screens.. I'm logged in to the account that I watch Netflix on everyday.. why would I need the free trial? I don't understand lol. Someone please help"
It has alot of great tv shows and movies but the problem is ever since the newest update happened I can't see what I'm watching. I hear the audio but the screen itself is frozen. Please fix
Phone COMPLETELY WIPED OF INFO N I DIDN'T DO IT. I can't seem to get Netflix to download to MY phone again. In trial period for Netflix but haven't had any services for last 3-4 days...since phone was WIPED clean of info. Upset n want to resume TIME for trial period. T.J.Robinson ü§îüòé
Finally caved after cable was costing me $100 a month just to have something playing in the background. But $13 for shows that aren't censored and new season of Jojo exclusively on Netflix is worth it. Still don't know why I can't watch some certain shows on my TV without it bugging out or why it wants to glitch on me.
I love the app truly but one problem isbthat some series are not completely For example the 100 only have 5 seasons on Netflix when it is a 6 season serie with a 7 season maybe coming out. So would you please be ablento add the rest of the seasons please. Thank you
"Netflix has a wide variety of movies and television shows, they never seem to have the particular movies I'm looking for. But I guess there would need to be a lot of movies to satisfy everyone. I wish they had Addams Family Values, it's my favourite movie."
It would be 5 but my app used to have a cast option and for some reason it disappeared from the corner of my movies and i no longer have that option. When i have that option back they can have their 5 stars.
"This is heaps better than Amazon Prime Video, but I'd rather watch Netflix on TV instead of a phone or tablet. I can't seem to enjoy Netflix comfortably that way. Stick to the TV versions..."
I love Netlifx but yall can fix your app cause I thought it was my wifi that wasn't working too well but it seems with the comments that its the app thats having problems. Sometimes it takes way too long to load and it shuts off mid show. Please fix it
i love it sometimes its slow but it is really good my fav tv show is the vampire diaries and outer banks the reason i love these shows is bc there is always some mystery. another thing about it is im trying to cromecast and its not really helpfull in this sinario. also it could use another update. and im really upset that you took the fosters off of netflix. if your reading this netflix pls pls bring it back and pls put another season on jullie and outer banks. other than that its an amazing ap
"On Android TV, when you rewind back more than 1 back click on what you are watching... It starts to clip sound like it is not downloading it fast enough, when you go out to main menu of what you are watching and then resume, then it's starting to play normal again"
"Whenever i try to open the app shows me an error saying - "" Sorry. We couldnot reach Netflix service. Please try again later. (-1023) "" And i have to disable it and then enable it to start the app.. Can you please help me fix the issue.?"
"I am changing my review about Netflix app via mobile / smart TV ....the app behaves really shallow at times wherein we have to uninstall and reinstall the app , which is not worth if ur paying 9600/- a year.....this is the only app which charges astronomically high for 5 screens plus UHD viewing.....don't mind paying also but at least give that service ....after paying that much if ur unable to view the content bcos of some bug then wots the use....hope Netflix team will action on feedback."
"App is amazing and I love it, only thing is picture in picture mode doesn't seem to be working, is there a possible update to resolve this (p.s. I have allowed picture-in-picture under permissions and phone is on Android 10)"
"So um I'm up to chapter 81 on one of episodes, I've just Google stalked it and it only stopped on season 4 for me, there's 6 seasons and 100 episodesüò≠this update needs to be fixed cause now because I'm xagoing to stalk places we're I can finish my episodes, thanks a lot. Will be changing my point of view once you give me what I've asked and wanted for."
All over it is awesome. I loved Netflix because it has lot of content/ web series / movie. I always watch series and movie from Netflix only. But few web series and movies must be dubbed in hindi too.. We want to enjoy them in hindi. But the monthly prize must be low so that many can get it's subscription.
"Love the app but one problem I have is you always take off the good shows or movies and you bring in really bad movies and shows. An example you took of prison break, mean girls 1, pretty little liars, the vampire diaries and now clueless. Why not get rid of riverdale or friends or the office as they've been on netflix awhile now. Please stop taking off all the good things, thank you."
"Wonderful,wide range of cinema and other video series.New experience of T.V. and mobile viewing.keep it up.T.V. viewing rates and subscriptions are very high so please consider this issue.Hoping for your help.."
Netflix is great but wish I didn't have to keep updating. Wish there was a way to not update and still watch. Also would love if netflix party was a app so you could watch on phone.
Having issues casting to chromsecast ALL the time. Other then that I like it.
"Overall, I like Netflix, but the 2 things that make me mad are: 1) When I try to download a TV series, one of the episodes won't download and just says error. 2) I hate that season get taken out of shows but the rest stays"
i like being able to watch stuff anywhere. but here lately the subtitles keep coming on even if i dont turn them on. also the screen that shows pause and all keeps going on and off and its a pain. why does that keep happening?
"I like everything! however, when you are watching with subtitles. Sometimes you cannot read them because the letter it isn't readable at all once the background in a movie is white or light."
"Lack of info on the titles. Complete info,ratings,and audio/language should be present when you just browsing them. Also Netflix should also include weekly/daily plans."
"Netflix doesn't work sometimes. I open it and it's just stuck on the opening screen all it says is ""NETFLIX"" but it doesn't load. I have to reinstall it everytime."
"They need to look at how YouTube does its app because theirs always works and the Netflix app is wishy washy. It works sometimes and then other times, nothing. Netflix makes tons of money, make a better app!!"
I think there are not so much options for movies because almost all of them I have watched and there are not those seasons which I need. I think Amazon prime vedio is good as compare to netflix but in Pakistan I can't Access to Amazon.
"i love the shows on Netflix, but the subscription prices has skyrocketed, and in my opinion its not worth the purchase every month. there's barely any new shows on there and they take away good shows, which is SO disappointing..."
I just hate how they're removing good stuff off it and also they keep on recommending me indian movies when I've probably watched one in five years and I disliked it. They need to get better with personalization! Otherwise it's advertisement and enjoyable.
"So I have this app on my computer and I log in and everything, but it stays on the 'Signing In' screen. It doesn't stop loading. I can log into the google version easily but the app does not work. Is there any way to fix this?"
"I love the app, it works perfectly on my phone, but on my samsung tablet I get no video :( The audio plays and I can pause or fast forward, but not being able to watch shows on a bigger screen is sad"
The app works much better before. Whenever you open a chathead from messenger Netflix automatically pause the video. Please bring that back or have an option you can toggle.
"Very glitchy and the app has a limited amount of things to watch it doesnt have my favorites, the hunger games movies or the harry potter movies but it does have a variety of good movies and shows i prefer the romance or mystery shows and movies."
netflix took my payment on december 15 th 2023.. but when i try to watch a movie .. it says my devise is not compatable.?????? whats up with that
It's saying can't connect to Netflix what do I do please?
"Most of the subtitles are iqncorrect and somewhat rush translation, which makes the movie/series you're watching lose it's depth of the story. Hope you guys improve the subtitles."
Would rate this a 5 star but they keep removing all these classic shows with ones we don't even ask for like Netflix Orginals which could get rid of to keep classics and as well they are upping the price so much yet look at Hulu they have better prices than you guys do and they have ads like this app will. Wish you guys would get your acts together and stop being the lower company. Show them what you are truely meant to be sround for. Good shows and actual stuff we will watch barely half of it
please dear devs there's something off about the subtitle please fix it.
It good because its free but you have to pay monthly and its fun to binge watch but the downside is that you can only have a limited amount of people who can watch at the same time and the graphics are good... somtimes.
"Everything is fine but manytimes the downloaded videos seem to become corrupt. I have to clear the storage, then login again but the downloaded videos are gone!!! Have to download them all again wasting my data"
"was 5 starts before it crapped out on me. I've had Netflix for over 4 years and I've never had it tell me ""this title is not available to watch instantly."" on every single title. this needs to be fixed."
"Loading has been bad since last update when connecting to TV, can cut off at any time abruptly and I have to re-buffer but then the same cycle happens...get it together with your billions in resources Netflix!"
Love this app but the problem is there not that much movies. I was wanting to watch naruto shippuden but its not available and i cant use vpn anymore. Pls add more shows. Would have given 5 stars if you add more movies and shows in other counries.
I hate it it says I'm out of the house hold and I can't watch any of my shows
"Hello Dev team! I'm experiencing a terrible bug... Whenever I pause and then try to play the play button can't be tapped üòì then I've to tap on the 10 sec back button to play again. I'm using Nokia 6.1, please fix this...."
"This app is great and has many shows, but Netflix KSA is like a free trial for money. There isnt as much movies and TV shows as in other countries. Please add more titles to Netflix KSA."
"please fix the audios, subtitles, languages.. and most importantly is add all movies especially marvel and dc movies.. just add all movie and other vintage or classic movies around the world.. other than that good job so far.."
Netflix keeps causing my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 to dim its brightness to a point where I can barely see what I'm watching. I'm getting tired of redownloading the app. It used to be amazing.
"does what you expect most of the time, minor issues at times but usually fixable by restarting the app or phone/updating the app. does not seem like they are working hard on new features though"
nice app but the graphics are not as good as they used to be. But i have to say netflix is a great app all in all but like i said before i would change the graphics back to how they were before all the updates.
"Netflix service is decent, but updates to the app sucks. Pls hide the 'play something' button if I'm literally already playing something, so I can use the playback controls. Very silly oversight."
"There is very less content to watch in Netflix india. Please add more movies Hollywood as well as Indian. Else, it's not worth the money. Apart from that, Netflix is great and I love the interface."
Netflix it's self is amazing but there are a few flaws for example you night be warchinf a show and take a brake for a bit snd it won't be on tour continue watching snd if u surch it up it starts from the beging or how u can onky have 4 acounts and only have it on 4 divisive but besides that is a prety good app bit some times it over charges me
"Netflix is too concerned with watch time that they won't let a movie sink in. When it is over they just feed you the next one. Who cares about letting you take some time to think about the experience you've just had? Or to perhaps enjoy the final credit Song? It might seem like a small complaint but it takes me completely out of the feelings of the movie and quickly reminds me that I'm just being spoonfed content. It's a prepaid service after all, how about letting the user have the choice?"
The app in general functions fine no issues so far but the thing that ruins it is the fact that y'all be cancelling shows that gain the spotlight and add other shows that ain't even good for example with Julie and the Phantoms it was a total hit and y'all made us wait a long time just to tell us that it was cancelled and there's no S2 coming out but want to add other shows that just simply suck bc of the nonexistent plot not to mention it's always the shows with new actors to get cancelled
"Audio only mode disappeared? It is beyond my understanding, how a good option introduced weeks ago is removed without any explaination. I was getting used to the audio-only mode. Please bring it back. Thanks"
"Several shows cannot ben seen on mobile devices as they are too dark. Some are plenty bright. ALL can be viewed fine on a TV screen. But if you're like me, then all your favorite ones will be too dark to see on your phone or tablet."
"I love Netflix, but I can't seem to work Bandersnatch on my device. The options show up for a split second and then vanish. please help!"
"Tried using this app before and it works just fine but last night, When i downloaded it. App won't go through. Error msg says it cannot connect you to netflix service. Is there something wrong with the app or my phone? Btw, im using Samsungj7prime"
That allows you to watch a lot of fun movies shows and everything else and like that's why I love it cuz I am addicted electronics because they're the best thing they can ever happen to you and it also can get you addicted like it does to me addicted me right now love every possible electronic the possibility to stop getting me to not watch TV is almost endless
"I really enjoy using this app, it has really good movies and is the best so far I have seen Am giving it three stars because it has a flaw too, I download movies on it and before I can watch them later on, it's deleted Please it needs to be fixed because I don't enjoy wasting data to download a movie and have it deleted before I can watch it but great app tho üëå"
The Netflix app on the phone is all messed up. it would not let me add things to my list of what I want to watch.When I watch a movie it glitches in some parts of the movie.
Recently the English audio language coming with audio description which all together make the whole watching experience bad.. it's very annoying hearing robotic voice. Please remove this option and provide only English audio.. hate the description update..
"Netflix is good for pc , terrible on mobile , i got QHD mobile display , good internet , stuck at 480p , though on pc it can reach 1080 easily. Other than that for you fellow indians , this app doesnt have all the movies you look for ."
"There is an annoying bug where if connected to a chromecast ultra, while browsing the library it does not show if the media supports 4k or hdr. It always just shows HD."
Well the app has lot of movies to watch...but pls I subscribe already why must it be dat I must have data to watch any movies.....pls since we subscribe den it should be free with no data connect and y will d movies stop while it still talking.....pls even if we had to use data it must be too consuming or rather it should be to download alone den we know we had to use data only not subscription and data
"Its good but it doesnt offer a lot of movies, most of the time when I search a movie (mostly old movies like paper towns, strange magic, the murders at white house farm, etc.), there is no results, so hopefully in the future, you'll offer more to watch."
Its a pretty good app it just doesn't work on my tv it will just kick me out of Netflix and say sorry this isn't available but it works on my phone so good app totally recommended. (Edit) So i deleted Netflix on accident and im trying do download its again but it says i cant even tho i have no games or like that on my phone so three star. Sorry
"I'm unable to get really low brightness when in full screen. I turn my screen brightness to lowest, but as soon as I go full screen with Netflix, the brightness goes up. Are you messing with the brightness controls of the screen? If so, please don't. Otherwise I don't know what is happening."
Black screen with audio still playing. I have a galaxy tab 6 and have been using Netflix for a long time with this device. Can someone please fix the problem.
"Picture in picture not working all of a sudden. Once I play a movie/show and then click the home button for PIP, the app just closes and goes into the background rather than playing an overlay of the content... Just installed the latest update today and the PIP issue is still unresolved."
there is some technical issues. anytime I watch videos its paused itself but still sound plays. please fix. Still 4 months and issues has not been resolved. I hate this app now.
Everything is pretty great aside from the weird setup of where things are but the bad thing in my book is the brightness override. I can't seem to get it to not make my brightness brighter so watching at night is a literal eye sore. Fix ASAP. It's been a problem for years
"The previews work sometimes, most of the time it just has the rotating circle showing its loading but never does but movie will play so I'll have to play a bit of the movie to get an idea of what its about.."
"All of a sudden without even updating the app, the screen keeps on portrait mode. Tried changing my phone into auto rotate still cant change netflix into landscape. Help! Can't enjoy if not in full screen"
The app doesn't always keep track of where you are in a series. After watching a few episodes it won't save your progress and will take you back to a previously watched episode when you go back to the series.
I face challenge when i have to hide the pause/play & forward/rewind option available in the ongoing video playing. I tried reinstalling the app as well but it's still same. Please fix this issue.
"Shows lag mid episode causing the image to freeze and audio to continue, then it skips ahead about 30 seconds. Rewinding just causes it to freeze again at the same point, no way to see what was missed"
"I downloaded some shows and when i started to watch it , there was a pop up screen saying device error.. Please fix it i have to download all the episodes again now.. Edit: i guess you didn't fix the above mentioned error but upgraded it as now I am not able to start up the app , it keeps loading and says device error later..."
Ever since the new update when watching a download after 15 to 20 minutes of watching the movie or show it automatically stops and the screen goes blank. When trying to launch the app again it fails to load
Stop asking me if I wanna pay an extra $7.99 to share my account every time I log in pretty sure years ago netflix tweeted love is sharing your password so apparently yalls love costs $7.99
"Hi netflix team, I can't pause or unpause the video I'm watching for some reason. I can play it once but if i try to hit pause, it doesn't stop. I'm using huawei p30, please fix. I tried reinstalling but doesn't fix it."
This app has great show 's and movie's but the thing that's wrong with it is that it takes away good shows for who knows what and sometime's they just take some seasons from the show and it's really annoying and then the next week or day the show is gone. I give this app aüëé for all the show's taken away.
For people like me that are paying big money for netflix you guys should be adding more movies for example you guys have the movie Halloween but wheres part 2? No hells kitchen and thats a show that i love to watch but we don't have cable so we can't watch all the episodes of hells kitchen. The Canadian netflix should be exactly like the American Netflix but its not when are you guys going to improve this app? Thinking about canceling my account
Good but ...the problem new realse movie are coming too late on Netflix...
Has a wide variety of show's and movies but doesn't quite fit for the wide variety of viewer's exact fast changing taste... Needs more up to par theatre play with both fiction and nonfiction film!
It's hard to download and it has a good quality love it
"Not bad but it missing a lot of features I really hope to add speed up to this app to be able to make fast playback for series to save more time, it will be wonderful if you really listen to your customers Thanks"
"Good shows,but I HATE getting asked if I am still watching. When I am done watching I am more then Capable of turning off my T.V. When you tell the retarded thing you are still watching it freezes and you have to turn off your T.V. anyway and turn it back on. Then find the show you were watching so you can watch 10 minutes over before you get where the retared thing asked you if you are still watching. I miss Free T.V. I had When I was young! I am over 60 these pay for TV app are stupid!"
"The app crashes everytime I connect to my wifi, this has forced me to stream shows using mobile data. Since mobile data is limited, I am not able to watch properly, please rectify this issue and I might consider giving 5 stars."
"The new ""play something"" shuffle button has never worked. All I get is a message saying ""can't connect to Netflix"" even though I am able to watch something if I actually select it."
"I can't use my sd card for the downloading videos when I updated the app. I don't wanna use my internal storage for downloads for it will cause lag to my phone. Please fix this. I was able to use my SD card before but now when I updated it, the option is gone."
"please fix the ""save to sd card"" problem with mobile devices"
Video will randomly freeze while the sound continues to go. Even if you rewind it will freeze in the same place and you can't see that part of the show/movie.
"Unable to login to my Netflix app. It just shows some error and I tried restarting the phone, uninstalled then installed the app but it's still not working. Please guide me how do I open the app and sort this issue."
"quite good as there is no ads, and you can watch offline when downloaded.. but some of the best series and movies are in english, even if its stuff from 2000!! please please make more old movies and series in french!!!"
"Love Love Love Netflix Originals!!! Edit: think it may be time for an update. It keeps saying There's a problem reaching Netflix. My internet is solid, all my other apps work except Netflix."
Honestly netflix show selection has been really lacking as of late most of the good shows have gone of the platform and al the shows that are their are mediocre at best the app self is easy to use and is really flushed out with a great user experience. 3/5 mediocre at best you're better of getting a subscribtion at hbo max
Video keeps disappearing and audio is still playing. Did not happen until the other day and now happens constantly. Only happens with the Netflix app.
Netflix is the best app to watch series and movies and animes but it is slow in many series to release in India as for some animes Season 1 is available but season 2 is yet to release . Please be a little fast on that.
The recent update is not user-friendly. I miss the ability to see the top 10 movies/shows instead of seeing panels of previews on the app.
"have great series but need to update movies more frequently for newer movies. currently cannot open my netflix at all, only stuck at the page where it says ""netflix"" for 2 days. please help."
"Use the edit icon to pin, add or delete clips.Touch and hold a clip to pin it. Unpinned clips will be deleted after 1 hour."
"This is a pretty good app as long as you don't want to watch any movie series, such as fast and furious The Expendables underworld The Avengers or pretty much any movie series at all because Netflix only brings out one or two movies of any movie series which completely wrecks watching any movie series at all"
New UI is terrible... I can only see two shows while scrolling now... Before I could see at least 15 on the screen. Very bad decision to try copy YouTube's UI. Edit: They have finally reverted the above. Thank you.
"The app is good.. Perfect and easy to use but there are limited movies and series. Some of the old movies are left out, cant find them. Shortcoming of the app is movies are very limited."
"Problems last 2 weeks of October onwards. 1. It asks me to sign in every time I access it. Email and password. 2. Every movie clicked. Error. This movie is not available at this time, try again later. Spent total of 2 hrs with tech staff and nothing is resolved."
"They mostly deleted good shows just to put in stupid ones that mostly no one will ever watch. They're removing Hunter x Hunter, Ouran High School Host Club, and many many more. I feel as if they shouldn't remove popular shows/movies just to put in new ones. Overall, i suppose its a good app i just dont agree on what they are doing."
"great app, love that you can download now. doesnt work for military tho, blocks files I download saying not available in your area. why did it let me download it then? more stars for better military support. maybe a profile with a billing address in US has profile associated there, not the port I'm in overseas for 3 days."
Having issues with it thinking there are too many downloads... wont allow me to download some things... just bugging out. I'm uninstalling and trying to reload as see if that fixes issues.
"Netflix, you probably don't care since you never respond to customer ratings..... but maybe you should know that the categories aren't working. The option for categories won't do anything. So until you fix it, I'm canceling netflix. Hulu and HBO max are far better than you."
"I really like Netflix and it's an amazing streaming device but I wish they had a wider selection of Anime movies, and I wish they hadn't taken haikyuu off of there because I was not finished with it. But overall Netflix is a great app."
Great movies. But I don't like it when I downloaded a movie with my data and to find out it was removed because it expired. I mean is'nt that the reason to down load and watch the movie whenever.
"Love the app and netflix in general but (even though this is most likely not Netflix's fault) I wish some shows like spongebob or adventure time were watchable on here, not to mention taking ages to update series or not having full series on (bleach doesnt just END after ichigo fights byakuya but nope i got go to 5 other websites to find the rest of it while i pay to watch season 1)"
"After Samsung released Android 9 for their phones, the app has stopped working. I'm getting error code while launching the app. I'm not sure if its the OS update or the app update."
"This was great in the for quite some time. However now as I stream, the video goes green while audio is playing fine. Reinstalled the app and the same issue occurs. Please assist, used on the OnePlus 6."
"After recent update, my Netflix app doesn't open, the app get stuck on the Logo page. All my other binge watching apps are working fine only Netflix is not working from last few days, I am using Red MI Note 8 pro."
"Normally I'd say it's 5 stars but since the lastest update I can't cast to my tv without it freezing and ""loading"" constantly. It's super annoying and makes not want to use it"
It was good previously but after last update all the shows are much darker almost to the point of becoming black. I have to increase screen brightness every time.
Why don't you add more seasons if they are available..
Too bad that's Netflix doesn't allow other payment methods. Not everyone have credit card. It'll be awesome if you considered to add Google Pay as one of your payment method.
"I love netflix, but Oh My God! I'm always in a certain mood where i want to watch something i haven't watched since i was little, but they remove the item i'm looking for and the replacement is a childs show with very grotesque animation."
Everytime I go to watch a movie on your app I get kicked out just as the movie I picked out starts I have to click on icon to go back to my movie. I find this to be very irritating and frustrating as well.
sometimes I could not open this app.. this is very irritating. so that I am editing my review. good and great contents.. some of the contents are very worst. specifically Indian contents are not that good. please work on these . there are very good stories in India. please work on it.
Difficult to keep guessing the movie names and search it in the app to check availability. Need a list view and also better options for forwarding/rewinding the scenes.
"App keeps throwing me out since it's been updated. I have constantly to re-install it, even then it stays good for a while. After that it all happens from the beginning, re-installing it again. Fix it please"
"The program is amazing with all the shows but I just have one problem, when I turn on a program it plays for about 1 second then the screen goes black/turns off but I still get audio"
It really sucks that the app is set to autoplay and can't be stopped from automatically playing anything you are browsing. The user should have full control of the app playback.
It's really good app honestly I love the umbrella Academy so much and other shows and movies but I give it 3 stars because now all of sudden I can't watch it on my mom's account because it's not on the same household so may this be changed please Netflix peopleüôèüôèüôè
with every major network making their own show apps like disney and others its only a matter of time before the only things on here are netflix originals. now dont get ne wrong they do have a decent list of good originals already but i doubt they can keep up the momentum esecially with how in debt they are soon it will go they way of blockbuster
There are too much content to watch but there is only one problem netflix. Only few of the korean drama are dubbed in hindi as well as in English rest of them are only available in korean language..i took Netflix pack just to watch korean series and i got disappointed after seeing that they only available in original audio Its a humble request Netflix please dubb the korean series at least in one more language wheather its hindi or english but please dubb them
"I am mystified as to why Netflix can't seem to be bothered to convert older movies and quality TV shows or documentaries to 4KHD quality when it is a fact that all the best content used to be made using 36mm film (which is perfect for the new medium). In truth I'm unlikely to ever leave Netflix and am an aggressive promoter amongst my family and friends, but they MUST address this gaping hole to deserve the top spot... Cheers one and all, Andy Hempel NSW Australia"
"Subtitles are still broken from previous update. Missing words, missing letters, random font sizes. Happens on multiple series and movies. Android 6.0.1 Netflix version 6.26.1 build 15"
It's a huge platform for entertainment.but problems is in the app.sometimes screen lock vaniched don't know the reason.also if any show or movie i already watched Netflix can't show me the resume option in history.i serched it but it's showing which shows trailer i was watched.plz make ur app perfect.
Everything is good but volume is very low in Netflix app.. Rest all other apps work wit loud... I think something is wrong with Netflix settings.. I'm talking about using mobile phone
"Overall its OK. But a lot of block buster movies they don't have. Some of the movie use to have on the app, but after awhile they take it down. Makes me really sad, like pacific rim 1&2 and some of the transformers movie. Like why? But some of the documentaries are pretty fly."
"A lot of the TV series I wanted to watch, ""American Horror Stories"" being one of them, didn't have all the seasons - and I can already tell that that's not a rare thing: many series available on Netflix are incomplete. I don't think it was a waste of money, I'm just disappointed."
Overall wonderful experience. Kindly fix the compatability on Samsung DeX. It is annoying as you cant make it full screen plus other minor glitches.
decent app. 3 stars because where im from we pay the full price but only recieve less than 10 percent of the content that other countries recieve... if you cant secure the TV rights then drop the price.
Cancelled account. Too expensive. Also you need to fix the profile section. I tried clicking on the app settings on my profile and it doesn't work. None of the links work when i try clicking on them.
Would give 5 stars if the picture in picture feature actually worked.... everything else is great
"One problem I have with Netflix is that, you guys don't have latest movies, just old, old movies. It's after the world is through watching it before it start showing up on search üîé,Please fix this."
Netflix is the best the besr in the world amd the content is just i am unable to describe but one thinga i can say netflix app uses sooo much of phone battery while using netflix my phone battery drains sooo quickley so please may be netflix can work on ot thats why i gave 3 stars only but the content on metflix is unlimiited stars and one more things youtube is also an online platforn it never drain that much of battery that pisses me of because i gave my suscribtion to my brother
We can't understand German language please translate movies in hindi and more which we can enjoy easily the Netflix
"From past 2 days i am not able to open my netflix app, whenever I click, it only shows NETFLIX in the middle of the screen and stops their. I have tried reinstalling it but nothing is happening."
"Add an option to disable hdr, as it looks terrible on phones. Video is so dark you can barely make out an image at full brightness. It's extremely hard to watch some shows."
"It can be better, there are some points which should be fixed . Like it does not resumes from where you left, new content of many shows , Series's are not available when they have been out months ago. We have purchased still have to wait. I can't understand. Not here then where?"
"I love this app so much but for some reason, when I watch something and then go on another app or turn off my phone, I can't find what i was watching anywhere. Even when i search it up on Netflix, it doesn't come up. It is like it never existed and completely disappeared. Can you please do something about this."
"What the heck is wrong with this thing called putting your payment in? I mean I already paid and this new update or whatever is saying that i have to put my credit card in or payment in in order to watch I cant escape the screen. Also, it will restart my membership right after if I do so. What the actual hell is this? I mean I really like netflix but why??"
There's a issue with Netflix... When ever I start a show the screen get stuck at loading and i can't even use my phone for a while... I try to lock the screen... But still the same a only see loading at screen and my phone automatically reboots and then only I can use my phone.
"Overall, a meh mostly because there are not many shows th at would interest me. Personally, I think there are too many originals and they made so if I want to watch certain shows I would have to get it. I wouldn't have a problem if it were available to buy the show somewhere else but it isn't."
"I tried to sign up for it and input my debit card details, I was debited twice but got a message that they were unable to process the sign up. I don't understand, please reverse my money. You guys are unreliable."
"The app is always loading and timing out. Plus now that Disney is pulling out of netflix, Marvel is going to withdraw. It's quite expensive for what it's now going to offer. It's been good. But I might have to quit."
"It has some nice things, but if you watch something to much, they take it away, their was a t.v. show I really like on Netflix and they took it away before I could finish it, and I haven't found it anywhere else."
"hii, I am not able to use it on my television, tried many times but everytime it says something went wrong, there was an unexpected error. please reload the page and try again. help me out."
"Why Netflix not accepting rupay card.. I have tried multiple to do payment as I am a regular user. But some how I didn't update my account. *NETFLIX"" NOT ACCEPTING RUPAY* I Just spoke with Vabhaiv one of your executive he very well help me. But it's a red alert for Netflix. Lots of people using RUPEE PAY CARD. Only HDFC not acceptable... Pls add on multiple PAYMENT SYSTEM So CUSTOMER have freedom to update account with their choice of banks... . I CAN'T BELIEVE NETFLIX DON'T HAVE RUPEE PAY...."
"Ok Netflix, you need to get it together, a lot of people a few e upset that with all the updates happening there episodes of there shows are not coming out. And for my favorite show, new episodes are released but you released them like a year after they all came put and I am getting tired of it. If your going to update that actually wait until you have all new episodes or at least half of them. Please just add all the episodes in well the ones that are released so people can enjoy Netflix."
Its a good app and all but they are slow at updating new movies and they always take good movies and series out and replace them with bad and budget ones and they usually leave trash movies that people rarely watch on it. Oh......... and I want more anime:))
I would rate this app 3 stars because sometimes in the outro its meant to say next episode and sometimes it does not work so I go on more episodes to go into my next episode and I scroll all the way from episode 1 to episode 178 and It takes me back to the beginning... However its an amazing app in general
"Netflix does not have that much movies to watch in the kids. Also sometimes when I watch an episode, the screen gotten black and no matter what I try it still cant show."
"For some series , subtitles font are coming white . Its difficult to read subtitles . Even after correcting in the settings , nothing is changing. Pls fix this issue ."
"Why on my TV, Netflix doesn't detect the tv remote, I meant for up, down, left and right. So i cannot choose/view the movie thumbnails. I just can click 'OK' on the remote. Please solve this problem!"
"I have updated this app several times, but this has started new, it doesn't resume from where I have left off in the ""Continue watching"" section. It didn't happened previously, but is is happening now. I have the latest version of app but still the issue persists."
"Worse with every update, same as most things. Newest update now has ""Watch what other people watched after *blank*"" as a whole row, but its almost every row! Out of 44 rows, 14 were the as above stated ""Watch because somebody liked it"". Not 1 was recommended for "" Me"". And the UI is in the same boat, worse every update."
"App is fine. Seems like it hasn't evolved with the times. Limited options, features, functionality. They also keep cancelling shows."
Are you continue watching Ugh remove that i was in the middle of watching stranger things then that popped up and something amazing was happening and add all seasons of all shows not just Netflix original cuz we need to watch all full seasons please and it will just switch off most the time but other than that we are good it has good movies sometimes good quality adds new popular shows so its good
Will someone please tell the app developers that this ridiculous audio sound between choosing profile & going to start page is: (1) Startling; (2) obnoxious; and (3) serves no purpose other than to be incredibly maddening. Thank you.
Not liking the video on or off that shows constantlyon the screen. It could have been better if it was just part of the settings. DONT put it in the midlle of the screen
its so annoying that most of the shows arent even available in austria like we dont get anything would be much cooler if you guys could upload more tv shows for us bcs most of my friends stopped watchin netflix cause there were nothin to watch we are getting like 2 movies in 1 month thats a bit to low also why ist the flash notavailable when its on prime video? and supergirl season 4 or arrow season 7 most of the countries arround austria has altheseshows and its extremelyannoying tohear spoilers
I wish I could use this app in my old iPad mini devices but it cannot download (not competible) or watch it even on Safari. üò£ I could watch it on the tiny screen of phone or spend more time to start up laptop.
"@Stefanois Sd is right, pls fix d problem it's keeps crashing and most time it's slow dat could be so annoying, I thought I was d only one having such challenge watching Netflix but no pls fix so u don't loose customers very important. My Ig handle is (officialnania_sam) for more complaints if u need to ask more of my Netflix issues. Regards..."
"I jave been using netflix for years now.. Firstly, it takes more MB while using mobile data... And secondly, if we pause and go to another window... We have to reopen the episode and drag till time... I hope you can resolve the issues."
"Experiencing sound issues, conversations are low and background noise such as music or explosions are loud. Hard to balance when kids in bed. Annoying to constantly change sound type per episode."
I love netflix but it's genuinely making me angry that I can't make my brightness higher bc the app is in control of my brightness panel. So I'm at lunch sitting outside and i can't see the screen cuz I can't make the brightness higher because for some reason netflix is in control. It's frustrating for sure
"The trailers for shows and movies give away too much of the plots and I lose interest in watching it. I like Netflix and most of the original content is great, but stop giving away spoilers in the previews and I will raise my rating."
It's good! Before I was able to continue with the dramas where I have stopped but now it's not happening like that as it goes to starting of the episodes viz annoying. And it would be great to update the new K-dramas which are On air once it gets completed.
"Love the content but the app and service sucks big time. There seems to be no intelligence behind recommendations, completely ignoring (dis-)likes or taking into account already seen content. Such a missed opportunity."
I have been a Netflix PREMIUM user since 2018 but now my phone suddenly lost support for HD content and I can only view in SD due to Widevine BS. They say it's manufacturer fault. Idk what to do anymore.
When i intially downloaded netflix it was working really well. Then recently i realized that after an update was done i have to unistall and reinstall the app for it to work. This has become very frustrating
"App is great. Works perfect, but it sometimes drains battery although I don't use it. I Uninstalled and cancelld the subscription because I don't wanna be associated with pedophiles."
"The app is buggy again, the UI controls (play/pause etc) stay on the screen when I tap off them. It's getting really annoying now. Fix this please."
"I've been trying to open the app on my phone and instantly crashes and won't open, I uninstalled and download it again and keeps crashing when I'm opening, this didn't happen before I updated my android system from 8 to 9"
changes lenguage after EACH episode if watching a series to the default (?) lenguage (the original one with english subs if not in english) even if the lenguage of the account or profile IS NOT ENGLISH. Is extremely annoying and is been this way on this app for way too long.
"Loved the app but hate the new brightness thing they've introduced, just stick to the same brightness as the actual screen please like it used to be or at least introduce a setting for it. Other than that its perfect"
"Absence of on-screen volume control is really really irritating. Please add it. It will be of great convenience. Kindly put it on the right hand side of the screen, just like the brightness control on the left hand side."
"App ok. I wish for better functionality to filter out what you have seen/mark items as seen. Also, always provide subtitles in the language (english) that the movies are in."
"Netflix is freezing on my hwawei phone. It just keeps on loading. I am unsure why, while on the ios device its working well. Please help fix this bug. It just started when I downloaded movies."
Gives notifications (about a series that is now available) even though notifications are disabled in the app. I have now disabled the notifications in the Android settings instead. Still a good app.
Other than the fact that they seem to cancel all of the good shows and replace them with junk. As well as they haven't added channels/ subscriptions like prime or hulu has done. If they continue to release weekly episodes I'm out of here.
This app is very awesome but the price is very high as compared with hotstar and other entertainment apps. Amazon prime best with charging very less amount which is not with netflix. We indians cant afford it. For mobile it should be less then 199
Want more k-dramas in hindi....i want URDU subtitles if u cant dubbed them in hindi
"Works sometimes, it's free with, T- Mobile ."
The new update made me lose the practical widget...
I think that Netflix is canceling all the shows that people love
"Fix the app... keeps signing me out forcing me to uninstall/restart my phone and hope it's fine... also fix the pixel scrambled screen that appears....dont know why the app said ""older version"" when it's the updated one.. hmm"
"-1 star. It's unfortunate the leftist in this company will cause it to lose a lot of subscribers. Some of your ""comedians"" are total idiots and no where near funny. How much extra do you pay them to say the n word in their goofy shows? They say it so much, an intelligent viewer wonders what kind of bonus pay they get for saying it. It's obvious the leftist decision makers at netflix think we're dumb, or want to dumb us down."
Subtitles keep coming on and movie/show will all of a sudden stop playing and take you to the home screen. If you cut off subtitles they automatically cut back on the next episode or movie.
Nice but no widgets will work after update.?
There should be HD available in Mobile pack membership if it is possible to include it then it would be successful for Netflix or else the mobile pack plan will be failure for Netflix in future. My words may be harsh but later it will be the future fact. Thank You
"Failed to connect, limiting my access"
Bruh why do we have to pay I can't even play bloons td 6 Netflix cause of it
"There is bug in this app. Check ur mobile application. There is a background playing without me being on the app. When I'm outside the app and I play some other video from other app, ex. Whats app, after the video finishes in other app Netflix starts playing in the background. When I'm still outside Netflix. Please do check."
"There is not a whole lot to pick from on netflix anymore. I cant stand a film that has a different language replaced with English, and all of the foreign movies and shows. Not to mention how over the top they shove gays down everyone's throats. I dont know any gays at all, why is it so important to try and pretend the entire world is conforming to the widespread narrative.. cause we arent. No one is interested in the gay and trans bs that netflix is trying so hard to make people beleive."
Netflix keeps taking off good movies
Getting hard to sign in and major buffering
"It's good, but I would like it if there wasn't an 'English' version. Why can't it be the same as everyone else's? There is so many great films/series I wanna watch but I can't BC it is featured on the American version it's dumb if u ask me and its the only negative thing about Netflix"
Why is the widget suddenly removed? I need my widget.
Won't save to SD card
"looking for xxxx, we dont have it but you might like this"
Good app but to many adds not enough game play
I like Netflix and there are so much movies to watch but they deleted movies?
I cant watch netflix when i am in a call
"It is appreciated, I hope 3rd parties don't turn out to be as most others"
It is good just some minor issues but interesting
"Plz give dubbed (HINDI) version of korean dramas.. My demon, acheme of soul's, the affection of king, Tomorrow, garduain, hidden love, True beauty, Hotel delunna, Korean odessy.. Hope you read my review and work on it.. Give update with these dramas of dubbed version!"
"I like it but i dont know after playing couple of episodes, it automatically closes or gives error n video stops playing. Right now I can't even open the app and it has happened couple of times now. FIX IT"
It was a Super App but it was asking money so I didn't like
"Netflix never let's me change my download location to sd card, the option to change it is there but when I select sd card for storage it reverts back to internal storage without a warning. I'm using Samsung Galaxy Tab A8, Android 13 One U.I 5.1."
The app won't load hunterxhunter since I finished ep.27
"How is it that every month, like clockwork, the app encounters some weird issue during the update that doesn't allow me to watch the episodes I'd downloaded (Error 2.100) and I'll need to wait for the next update to resolve the same? Get it together Netflix üò£"
"It's Okay, But It Should Have The Option Of Bollywood Movies And Shows... üòî"
Fee's keep increasing with 4k keeps lagging?
Is an good App for me but after subscription my brother has more movies than me on free movie box why
All over its good but the need improvement in Video player. When I touch the screen this ‚èØÔ∏è‚è∏Ô∏è‚èØÔ∏è Screen comes but when I tap 2nd time it doesn't go away and its irritating.(I have OnePlus7) please fix this if you can. Otherwise 5 star
Streaming is good but remove the house hold network thing
Very nice but there is not available other movies
I'm unable to play videos while I'm on call
It has been running slow lately
Im having a issue that when i open netflix its always loading even tho i have a stable network connection but still the problem persists then i have to re install it and then it starts working but i cannot re install it every time i have to watch something if you could pls do something about it
One thing that bugs me. There is no subtitle for the picture-on-picture display. There is a very little chance thaf the subtitle appeared but maybe it's only a bug.
Search engine not working
I hate how Netflix is taking everything away.... why are there no trailers anymore now too?
"I did love netflix when i first signed up, but unfortunately they have removed quite a bit of shows and movies that i really loved watching. I would use netflix more but it seems as though all my favorites are gone. :/"
"I am unable to watch movie, its just showing loading."
"I love watching the movies while playing a game or surfing the web but now the pip is not working. I reinstalled the app, made sure everything is turned on. I just don't get it. Help."
"The issue that really bothers me in this app is when I do system update on my phone, the shows that I downloaded prior can't play anymore thus I need to re-download it. It's a waste of time and energy. Please fix it! I pay for premium so please!"
I gave it 3 stars because it always plays the movies really dark an hard to see.. cant change the brightness.. always says another app is controlling brightness.. I have all them turned off so it's got to netflix doing it.. not happy at all!
I don't know why.. But all of a sudden it gets very slow while downloading and streaming. My network is fine works at mac speed but while dowloaing something from Netflix it doesn't even cross 50kbps
"For me, I enjoyed this app. I enjoyed watching movies and series but the reason I just rate it only 3 stars because it says I have errors in playing the videos sometimes. Other than that the app is pretty good it just need some fixes though."
It's nice i love it but i can't watch it offline even after paying for it
"I used to love to have the pop up view in my phone while I was texting or reading my notes, also loved when I could just hear the episodes, now I don't find the option to do it."
"Not working on cell phone. Oddly enough, the app is not working on my phone but works on my tablet. I dont know what's the difference. They both work on wifi. I don't know when or why the app stopped working on my phone but it has. I've updated and everything, and still nothing."
"Day after day shows are uploaded less. If we check some good movies to watch, any genre, we get the bootleg versions of the original ones. So please, upload more good shows or movies. Older ones included"
"It doesn't work well with my Chromecast, which is how I watch Netflix 90% of the time. I have to restart it frequently because the play/pause contol disappears."
"i appreciate your presence and efforts, but must say... every broadcast is more focus on music background, which is somehow lacking of speech quality. would request to please have a look. good luck for future"
"When i download this in laptop and download a ""sweet home"" and i go in my downloads and enter the pin,it says ""incorrect PIN, Please try again"" even the pin is correct(and offline too). But when i have internet and search a movie and i put a PIN, it worked but in my downloads its not working. Where i can send video? To prove"
I am using it for 2 year but recently about a month I am facing lot of problems whenever I forward the video it stops and doesn't even forward its like I am watching YouTube on 2G network and it's keep on buffering really I am feeling like end my subscription cause I am loosing my interest.
the app is fine however the constant change to the search section is irritating. And there should be more app settings this latest update made the background white I'd rather the classic black background since its easier on the eyes.
"After recent update on 12.07.2022, my application is not working and just saying the line ""Would you like to watch on this tv?"" My application got stuck and nothing is happening now. No option is appearing. I have tried 4 to 5 times. Please look into the matter at once."
Hi Netflix!! It's my first time to subscribe on Netflix and please have a feature that you can control the video quality because it annoys me when the video quality is on lowüò≠
So many spelling and grammatical errors in the subtitles. Please go see the subtitles for mob psycho. sometimes I'd rather watch on other websites.
"I give it 3 stars becouse some of the series of netflix are not completed. I've been watching Hilda a while now, and their was no season 3. But google said that NETFLIX, season 3 of Hilda will be out in MARCH 3 2021. Ive checked it, their was NO season 3 their. Same thing with the seiries ""Reincatnated as a slime"" series, season 2 was already OUT and yet NETFLIX DOSENT HAVE THE 2 SEASON. Ill rate it 5 when its updated REGULARLY with COMPLETED seasons."
Still okay... but selection quality is declining. Prime and Disney offer better choices. Don't like regional separation of movies and shows. Will likely un-subscribe soon after 10 years.
"I like this app but it always has like one out of four seasons of a show, barely has any classic horror movies, and the only thing that put the above Hulu or any other streaming service is that it has no ads, other than that Hulu and HBO max have more shows and most seasons of a show"
"Great app, but there is no email notification for when the password is changed. My brother's account kept getting hacked and his password changed but he didn't get an email notifying him. In this era, this shouldn't be lacking in a paid service. That was disappointing."
"Unable to uninstall on Android, I no longer have a subscription this feels like bloatware on my phone. Please give the option to delete the app."
Need to change movies more often. And put more in ENGLISH. then in other languages. Other then that it ok. But you can make it better. Some if not most of the movies you can't play because there not in ENGLISH.
"""You worry about what to watch next"" is a disconcerting update description in a time when companies are taking advantage of the information they can mine from mobile apps. Why not just tell us what changes you're making on our devices? The general user experience is good. I do wish there was a way to set playback speed. Quality content is seriously lacking. I'm a single guy in my mid-30s and I would like some cleaner, more intelligent content."
Lately the app keep on stopping my viewing every 2 mins. Can I know why is it acting weird? Even my downloaded movies or episode keep on stopping and goes back to the main screen and i have to start the movie or series again.. please help
"Everything is great exept sometimes the screen freezes but subtitles still going on. Please fix this bug, I reopen the app multiple times but it isnt solved."
The phone app is better than the PC app but damn Netflix stop sending 4 notifications at one or a few minutes apart for the exact same info. All you won is that I've now disabled the notifications -.-'
GODAMNIT NOT EVERYONE OWNED A CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD I'm really satisfied with network billing but it seems to have a problem to use that method of payment now.. I'M CRAVING FOR GOOD SERIES SO PLEASE MAKE IT EASIER FOR US TO PAY the last time i tried to subscribe i have to fill in my credit/debit card idk know about NOW because I've uninstalled it a while ago and i don't think NETFLIX cares because hey they're making a lot of money so one less subscriber wouldn't hurt right
Limited selection of popular movies and new seasons of shows which are not netfix original come very late
Works good for the most part. However lately it has been logging me out in the middle of a show or at least every hour. Also I do get audio lag from time to time
Hdr üôÑ let us turn hdr off in settings I can't stand it it makes everything look dull and colour less how it's invented as a feature is beyond me
Your content is good but please make some improvement is your app experience basically wrost experience I tried 2days to restart my membership for payment process after two payments done but I am not able to sign in. Please make easy and glitch free interface otherwise no use of such great company.This is happening with second time now I fed up with process.
Excellent app. But I have an issue where every time I use it ot overrides my phone's brightness and maxes it out and makes it unbearable to watch in low light conditions. (Using a OnePlus 5)
"The app works quite well, no real issues but like so many, I'm going to give up on Netflix. Their woke agenda is just irritating and cheesy, if the show says Netflix original, you quickly learn to avoid it."
"It freeze a lot. After 10 minutes I cannot press stop or pause or and even if I close and force stop the app, the video continues and does not disconnect the streaming."
"more and more glitch, I find myself constantly restarting app and having to re-download all films and series due to an error. Screenshots still not allowed even if you paid for the content."
"I'm giving you three stars because 1.im trying to login and it keeps telling me incorrect password and I have changed it like thousand times,now I've uninstall and about to install again and 2.why do you guts like taking movies out of there please bring back true beauty,and I hope if I install and it doesn't come I don't know what to do you will have to refund the money I payed"
Suggest that the interface for phones would also be able to rotate vertical and horizontal. Also top ten shows is not available on the phone as a list that we can browse
Can we please get the skip intro button on the app like we have on the webapp/smart tvs? Also the skip 10 seconds button. Only 30 secs rewind button is available on the app.
On one.pluse device this app plays the video even if we don't run the app . This happens when we push the video in background and leave it.suddenly the Netflix videos start playing...
"It would be incredible if they added a function to mark chapters, seasons or series as viewed, it is incredibly uncomfortable to know that you watched a series but the platform does not register it."
"It would be great if you can auto adjust the font size of subtitle between desktop view and apps view, so the subtitle wont covering entire phone screen if set into maximum subtitle font size. Please do your magic!"
Netflix was good but then started taking off amazing films with no warning... I went to watch the hunger games the other day and found it wasn't there. Which is weird considering I watched on netflix before I find this very disappointing. However it is a good app so I gave it 3 stars
"App is fine mostly. I wish you could hide suggestions (rating thumbs down makes no difference) so you don't always see the same stuff. And the new fast laughs tab is just dumb. It's a streaming app, not IG or Tik Tok where we need clips."
"I am new to Netflix and u all know that without an existing Netflix account u can't experience the thing. Here comes the trouble, it continuously shows ""you can't sign up now, please try again later"". Please fix this."
"I was going to get this using a Google play gift card my friend bought me for my birthday, but you didn't accept gogole play credit. Really disappointed."
"Once I hit the pause button, and then try to play it again, the play button isn't responding. I have to use 10 secs backwards everytime to start playing the video again."
"When every i download a video it doesn't work on my phone but it works on other applications and what them there but not in mine and it really annoying how only works like that it is there is an update i should do or should I uninstall it then install it again or what should I do?, But there in nothing wrong with the app it amazing and ready in joy using it it just the downloading problem."
"Nice , but more anime content should be added"
"Lately it's malfunctioning, often I'm watching an episode and suddenly it starts over, and also sometimes when I leave an episode half watched and exit the app, then go to the episode again, it's from the beginning, not from where I left it."
"Could use a wider selection of shows and movies. Constantly find myself searching other apps for the movie I want, and would rather be on just one app."
Used netflix with a 30 day.free trial in Jan. 2020 paid a few months at a higher rate than discussed. Trying to get confirmation on a years viewing already paid with.credit card. Can't get Netflix yet on mobile phone. Please send instructions.
"With regards to the error message ""could not reach the Netflix service (-1009). Just Uninstall and reinstall the app. Then it works again. Ps. Netflix please add new stuff. Getting bored."
"Be careful of scams related to Netflix claiming missed payments or canceled subscription, they are fake. Check with Netflix before clicking any links, I've been getting text claiming to be Netflix and saying I needed to make payments. Stay safe and enjoy sharing your account."
I love Netflix but Everytime there's an update I have some sort of issue. As of right now I can't use it in my phone at all. Which is upsetting since this is how I usually watch Netflix.
Started having problems on my phone app and on my smart TV.. it signs me out while I'm in the middle of a show on my phone and on my TV theres times where I cant even watch anything bc it says theres a problem my wifi is on and everything else was checked Netflix just doesnt work properly for me anymore
"App on my phone is not working. I was able to use Netflix app on Wednesday morning, then in the evening it has been not opening up. I uninstalled app 2x now and still not working. Please fix the problem!"
good shows reasonable price..but constantly buffering..every time I call i get the same instructions to solve the problem with no resolution..fed up and cancelled after 6 years..i never had that problem until recently but enough is enough..
Something is wrong lately. My shows start from an episode i've already seen. And even though i use the same account on Tv and phone the app ignores the episodes i watch on tv and starts from phone activity. Or otherwise. Sometimes ignores the same device activity...
My biggest issue with the netflix app is picture in picture not being supported on android 8.0 after many years later. Aside from that everything else is fine.
Whenever I turn into other app and come back the the video always showing loading and didn't work properly.. I always have to turn off my phone to restart using the app
"Nice app, variety of shows available. Only thing is when I project the app through HDMI, UI seems to be not mirrored on second screen, not able to display subtitle during playback."
Netflix plz allow HD streaming for Infinix mobile phones.Whatever Widevine security certificate you have to give for a device to be able to watch shows in HD.Its not a popular phone brand but its all i have plz.I bought Infinix device recently and i am heartbroken to find out that I can't stream shows in High definition.
It has a lot of my favorite shows but the problems i had were on the mobile app it keeps pausing the video and only having the audio play and i dont like the fact they removed a lot of futurama from there service
"Netflix is really great app no doubt, but so many Hollywood movies which are actually dubbed in Hindi are available only in English. It's a major drawback.. Otherwise great app.."
The app is great but I feel like they get rid of shows that are amazing I wish they would add more shows that we all love like more movies directed by Hayo Miyazaki. Right now the only Ghibli movie they have right now is castle Cagliostro. The last day to watch it is may 14th and I don't want it being replaced by something stupid like some infuincer series I want movies that I can watch that will be unforgettable (mainly anime) but Netflix has blocked vpns which is ridiculous
edit. after some long frustrating minutes I finally got hold of a support team member(live chat). he or she was very helpful and very responsive. however I cancelled my account due to the inconvenience. might use again later. my account just got hacked and I have no way of contacting the netflix team. I have spent more than a hour on the live chat and searched for any effective email that I can use. can I at least cancel my account amusing the original login info? please help.
"Would be great if shows can be sorted by the country of origin, year published and language. Basically more sorting options cause personally I find that finding a show that interest me to watch is really hard. Also, is there any difference in the accounts? On my dad's account I can find Princess Jellyfish but on my account, I can't find it."
Gta and other rockstar games not supported on S22 Ultra. Please fix this issue.
"should've been 5 star fpr my past experience. but i don't know since the new update i can't even get past the Netflix screen. so now i can't even watch netflix on my samaung galaxy s8+. please rectify the problem. i've uninstalled and reinstalled, problem still there."
Having issue not opening the app.... Just displays netflix wallpaper and doesn't proceed. Tried uninstalling and install didn't work. Tried clearing cache and storage data also. Is not working. Please fix ‚öíÔ∏èüò≠
"i like netflix, in these days theyre releasing the old movies that they remove and i liked that but i just want minecraft story mode to be released againüôèüôè"
Overall I'm happy with it. However I am dissapointed that the audio only feature has just vanished and I cannot find any explanation as to why it's gone. I used it quite a bit and now it's missing which kind if sucks.
Would give you guys a full 5 stars if not for the inability to use the app on slightly older versions of tablet. Please understand that we cannoy constantly change our devices to suit your app. You gotta cater some workable versions for older devices such as andriod car players.
The app overrides the phone brightness level. The screen becomes too bright and doesn't let you lower it down via the brightness bar on the side.
"I am super upset Netflix dropped Daredevil, and let a large number of its users down. The app works fine and there are alot of good shows, but in the cancellation of one of its ""top shows"" I can not with reason give it 5 starsüò¢. the show was canceled at a cliff hangar so there really isn't much more I need to say."
"will Netflix dosen't have everything that I want to watch, but hulu...IS WAY BATTER then Natflix hulu as almost everything than I DO want to watch if people read this then go checkout hulu it's free you can sign in for free I'll still give Netflix a 3 star cuz it dosen't have everything people want to watch orr see. Hope this becomes helpful to the people who are reading this.üòÅ"
"With this update, they have removed few useful features like next episode from the bottom tab, skip button. Video pauses whenever whatsapp opens up in PIP mode which do not serve the purpose of this feature."
I notice a bug where the control panel wont close eventhough i tap on other area. It will go away after around 30 seconds. Hopefully it will be fixed soon.
Netflix needs to add newer shows / movies. They have taken all the good shows out to put an old shows that are even not good. Some of the stuff that they have put on I can admit some of them are good. But they need to get better at picking the movies and the shows that they put on here.
Why my mobile goes power off when I just turn off screen with Netflix on? Please fix it.
Current version giving some scroll issues in every watching section! Fix this bugs.
Onscreen controls are not disappearing when tap on the screen please fix
For the cost I pay.. the subtitles should work on TV shows like outlander..
I still like this app but y'all get rid of all the good shows and movies and keeps the bad ones
Using the fast forward 10 seconds causes the app to lock-up.
Good option to watch new and old movies or web series but premiere prices are so highüò≠
Very few movies to choose from..much better if you add some old movies like western cowboys like clint eastwood movies.
"Edit December 2023: Latest update gets glitchy, slow framerate (my phone can handle 4k just fine), please fix"
Need to find old and new movies and I hate when my downloads expire even when I don't have wifi but still good
If logged out .can t able to login... interface showing wrong psswd..even if i put correct one..
The content is losing it's charm and it's not enganging any more.
Since last update I can't watching movies All the movies I play it's going slowly kindly fix it
Price is decent but series and collection nowadays sucks all old movies good series are being stopped....
Experience is good But it keeps resetting on its own while watching .
"Maybe netflix can change method to login, maybe using sms code. Tired for me, I have 2 house, why only 1 house only for tv"
"i really really like Netflix but,when I download some movie I can't watch it in online/offline..."
Bad update mixed colegries in single row. Previous version is good .
I can not look at episodes and it seems to block me at times .
Watchlist scrolling is too slow i.e I can't see my whole watchlist which I've added
There are old movie and new ons but short alot new movie that are advistised on internet and more series like blue blads ens.
Having issues on my phone frustrating I've turned phone off I've Uninstaller I've updated Nothing works
Another update another time the Chromecast icon has been taken away.
Could be perfect five stars if not the brightness would be way too intense
Unable to check or change the picture quality during playing any videos online
Need to have an option on kids profile to turn off the cast...so my kids quit putting there shows on the tv when I'm watching it
"Doesn't have all the options you get on desktop, which is annoying"
"k-drama's are available in hindi but animes not, why? we all are paying but still we are not getting hindi dubbed animesü§ß. I wanna enjoy animes in hindi languageüôÉ."
"Screen is being stuck on ""Netflix"" even after update."
"Lack of actual variety, my downloads (online shows) disappeared...I DONT WANT YOUR G** D***ED GAMES!!!"
Hi netflix!!! I have a small request to you please.. that you should add urdu subtitles in videos and movies
Not a bad app but some delays are there plus slow downloading....
To many very old movies. And to many whitout subtitles
The fact that you guys now have Commercials smh... We've had Netflix since 2006. Why you gotta follow the fads of other companies. Freaking sellouts
This app is very nine but it needs add more movies and shows!
Some TV shows are not available in Hindi Language
It's very fun to watch Netflix because there's no adds to disturb you
This app is really good I don't think Netflix should make people quit password sharing
"Not user friendly, cannot upload movies viewers search for"
"Eh, its okay but theres never anything new. Its cool for my ND brain, bc i like to rewatch the same 5 series over and over, but most people arent like that."
It is a good movie and tv app there just needs more of a variety
"I always watch netflix on my dad's phone but then today (March 11 2020) I decided to download netflix on my phone to put on puffin rock for my baby brother but it takes FOREVER to load plz fix, also I think it's been a hour now waiting today for it to load. No seriously plz fix anyway while I wait for it to load I'll write this, so I'll give it a three star because of two problems. 1. It's taking forever to load. 2.I'm waiting a BUNCH of time waiting here.ill deleat1star if connection lost."
Too bright. Please take off the brightness slider.
Please add Chinese language as an audio option.
Good but payment method is difficulty so this is troubling issues. Plz solved this problem
Everything is good but naruto shippuden and baruto is not in English language
Easy to use but does not keep up to date with relevant events
Would have been a 5 ‚òÜ instead of a 3‚òÜ I gave becase netflix has gone right down hill over the jas 2 -3 years in my judgement
"Not that good their are beyger options, since you have to play extra for any new accounts under your name."
Netflix keeps downloading movies ony phone without asking me even tho I turned smart download off
Adds pop up every 10 mins while watching movies an its annoying
"We want the rest of the episodes "" after we collided "" & "" after we fell "" & "" after ever happy "" & "" after everything "" please üôèü•∫"
Good. But the app needs a 30s fast forward.
No matter how they say for main is a simple words you kaindly install it and you will enjoy it thanks y n fellow fb
Overall Netflix experience is obviously better than any other online platform. But is lacking customer service. Really need to work on that.
Able to watch all of the movies that I want to see and I able to but I have problems trying to login most of the time and it becomes fairly irritating so that's why it gave 3 üåü instead of 5.
Consider adding an option to mute expletives in some movies. They're good shows on here but the language makes it hard to watch for some ears. So add that option for those who want to watch but don't like the language
"Decent movies, but a large ammount. For a year Netflix is super awesome, but after that you've watched every good movie and end up getting Hulu for a larger roster of shows."
Errors while playing on phone so much. I wish I would get what I am paying for. Either ur videos n audios are not in sync. Or videos pixilate and now new thing video doesn't play. If I am paying 6√ó more than other apps I expect least problems here.
love Netflix but the subtitles automatically is turned on. I'm unable to watching an shows or movies without subtitles. have to turn subtitles off every times i watch something different.
Pls provide information about series whether it is available in certain languages or not in preview only
Plenty of good shows are being removed and not many good ones are being added. Considering the prices are always increasing i would hope that they add better shows but they are not. I might just delete my account and find a better application.
The controls are the same but when you press space when controls are shown it actully leaves the movie/show you are watching. By it if you like these controls but I do not.
Nice. Many series are good and interesting. Can time pass and can be addicted too. App issues are there. It's getting struck. Voice overlapp. Minor bugs
"I am unable to open the App despite download again. It works in the beginning then it didn't. This is very frustrating. Error Message: Sorry, we could not reach the Netflix service. Please try again later. (-1023)"
It's to bright üòé. Overridimg phone brightness settings!
Sorry to say but you need to improve your recommendation. You need to consider user language preferences as well. You need to add 2 more rails like latest in user preferred language and trending in user preferred language. For example my language was hindi and English but in any recommendation I didn't get soorbanshi movie. And I want to watch it.
So far everything is working great but the brightness level. It is really dark even with the brightness turned up all the way. It only makes the captions brighter.
"The in-app brightness control was the worst idea you could possibly think of. There is no option to turn it off. I'd like to control the brightness the way I am used to, or better yet, used not to with Automatic brightness turned on. Now I have to mess around with that little slider that sometimes disappears completely despite the Control UI being called."
"I don't understand what's the issue with Netflix, why don't they provide English audio on anime and even on Tamil or Telugu or any other movies or shows if we go on any other sites for anime English audio is available, it's not always that u have a mood to watch the anime in Japanese coz Netflix got some good anime like monster, bleach, Naruto, and many more but none of them have English audio but if go on any other sites we can find English audio for all the anime"
Great app next level content but there is a sort of problem whenever I switch to other app and come back there is glitch kind of screen i tried restarting phone but it continues and sometimes it automomatic restart my phone and my all work i was doing get lost This is very very irritating so pls fix ASAP rest good
"Same old CONTENT, nothing new. Keep paying monthly rent and keep watching old movies, which are available in You Tube or other wevbsites for FREE. Will cancel my subscription soon. Since a year hardly see something amazing in Netflix."
It was great until it wouldn't sign in. I called the Netflix customer service and they said to uninstall it. I did everything they told me and it still won't work. I had already paid my bill 5 days ago. This is not fair.
"I love the shows and everything but, This new update is so buggy like sometimes it would randomly play audio of the last thing I watched please get on this and fix it already. It's really frustrating. Sincerely"
"It takes years to load and the freezes out of nowhere. Also, we should be able to screenshot things, especially because that only makes us go to other places to do so."
Not happy with Netflix I was waiting a series on Netflix and you've cut me off
App is good and provides many movies the only thing thats bad about it is that some movies dont show up the same server where as theres Black Adam or Avengers Endgame in the Usa meanwhile the Philippines server doesn't have it. And its super inconvenient unable to watch that are anticipated in other countries. Why pay when you can't get the same options as other servers and its truly unfair to be unable to watch the movies that are very exclusive and hard to watch in other services
Wow September 3 went by so fast Netflix made a lot of people mad by taking down the vampire diaries not to mention the missing seasons of criminal minds. I am one of those people who are devastated at the loss of a comfort show I've been watching since I was 7. And in my opinion the supernatural show the vampire diaries is 100 times better than strange things. As I said alot of people are mad at you guys for taking away our comfort show
"Great movies and shows library, however it would be great if they add all types of movies so we can only use it and not depend on more than one source. Make it the place for everything. Price is good and worth it"
"Great movie selection and great quality, one grief though. When I download a movie or show and try to watch it offline, the app crashes with no explanation."
"Netflix mobile is cool. But it wont let me play any movie, it always says something like ""this title is not available to watch instantly"". for everything. It won't let me watch anything. please fix this"
Well it's OK but it doesn't have to many options to choose from and you only have one season of transformers prime and very poor quality when it comes to watching movies it's like 240 or 360 video quality I can't tell what I'm looking at because of the poor quality also please get kung fu panda üêº 1 and 3 and hellboy part 2 and need more seasons of transformers prime and transformers robots in disguise. Please fix thank you.
Its ok but it takes out the good shows and leaves the bad shows on there so there is nothing really interesting to watch and its getting very annoying for me to see very good movies/series etc. leave and still seeing bad movies/series etc. on there and not getting removed off.
I don't have any type of these credit or debit card so i think ü§î the pay method is very tough and i think the paytm and other method should also be available to bought an ID.. But the app is good to see new web series and entertainment movie and other things
"I like Netflix and the shows and movies, but my only problem is that it won't let me delete it. It keeps Making me update it and I've updated it like 6 times and nothing happens. It's really annoying and I don't know what to do."
"come on guys the search bar has been broken when you scroll down for months now, the ""series"" ""films"" buttons that goes underneath the search bar gets pressed instead and it's really annoying."
It's a great app the only two problems I have with it is that I have to use Netflix to change to brightness and when you use the small Netflix box and I go into the app to choose a different show it kicks you out.
"It's a great app for watching movies and serials as well as animes. But many animes are incomplete,so that's a bummer. Hope they bring in all the seasons."
"There seems to be a trend the last few yrs that Im not happy about. Netflix is making many of their original shows/films in third world countries, and dub it to english. Its to save money on actors, locations and licencing. The stories are generally good but the acting is horrible. Thats how Netflix affords making so much original material. The quality suffers."
3 star for content but 2 stars less because Netflix is not able to provide me HD and Full HD videos even though my phone is capable of playing them and has got the certification through update. Poco F1 user.
"To much filth, nudity and political motivated content. Not forgetting the social content. I don't want my entertainment to shove their opinion upon me. Nor do I want to see every extreme alternate life style constantly showcased on the the main page. No longer a member, will not be back. Netflix is the XXX place in entertainment."
"I have issues lately, sometimes it says trouble connecting with netflix, then now there is error on playing downloaded movies. Like what the hell. Please fix it, coz im paying you monthly."
"Too many bugs, freezes and glitches. Downloads VERY slow, inconsistent performance. AMAZON IS MUCH FASTER! Wasn't even told about upgrade right now üò¨"
Over the last week I've been able to watch TV program and added it to list then when I've gone back it disappeared no shows are staying on they either work on laptop and don't work on phone or the other way around either way annoying.
"PROS: ‚ñ™Ô∏èSome decent Netflix originals (After Life, Stranger Things, Witcher, Ozark..) ‚ñ™Ô∏èGood child controls ‚ñ™Ô∏èGenerally good selection of subtitles and dubs. CONS: ‚ñ™Ô∏èSo expensive I'm considering cancelling, especially as 4K is unreasonably priced. ‚ñ™Ô∏èNo integration with IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic or similar services. ‚ñ™Ô∏èNo way to speed up/down playback. ‚ñ™Ô∏èNo Google TV integration."
I like the app but it still needs more improvement like putting some warning signs on upgrading the plan because i accidentaly click that and change the plans already and i can't take it back even the customer service can't fix it too .. put more payment options in the philippines so that you can earn a lot more customers to subscribe to your plans . Please put blackoutline in subtitle .. the text is not readable if the video is too bright
"I want to inquiry about 'playback speed' All of things is going well, and I don't have unconvinient overall. However, one thing that I want to ask for is that can you set the playback speed be able to by 2x ? If my inquiry accept , I would really appreciate. Thanks for all your service."

I was enjoying Netflix at first but now when I play it it keeps showing loading and will not displaying anything nor sound. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it again and even updated and it's still the same. Please fix this. Thank you.
I download this app with adding My account details. As it shows they will notify to Subscribe. After some day's I received mail stating My password of Netflix has been change. Hope that will not effect My account.
Not working properly as many times the trailers of the movies are not working properly they just stuck and doesn't start and the information about the movies or series were also not opening so after the latest update there are many these kinds of bugs so please developers deal with it!
"Netflix is amazing but at the moment i cant access the newer riverdale episode!! I honestly dont know if its on my behalf or yours. I honestly cant watch it, i see the title and everything but it doesnt work! And on my phone i cant even see it!!"
I like Netflix good app but put a button to remove shows I've been trying to get rid of the same show off my continue watching list for a month keeps going back to episode one when I watched them all.
"I've been subscribing to netflix for quite a while and have watched a lot of series/movies available on netflix but why lately have I wanted to rewatch these movies/series not available? I've even added it to my favorites list, but it's still missing."
"Would like to have uniformity, as in: English subtitles for all movies even if they are Dutch e.g.. But yes good app. Sometimes trouble with Chrome cast (but which app doesnt)."
On the most part it works well not any issues. That being said the selection is the worst 80% of searches the movie was not available.
"Video selection is excellent, but at least allow us to use our native MEMC features directly from our device, Poco F3 for example. MEMC features is not kicking in even I'm streaming at full HD capacity. Stop limiting our device features."
"Well I'm a fan of this app, though it has been giving me problems especially when I'm trying to download series and movies . It tells me that an error has occured .. this has been happening to me recently that forced me to uninstall it out of my device"
"Worked great til I got my Note 20. Now it really sucks about ¬Ω the time. No audio, takes forever to load, stops in the middle of a show or movie. Just really makes me mad. This is the only entertainment I have."
Very low quality programs I wish they would just open up to all programs like US version instead of being so restricted in Canada where there are more foreign programs then good ones also have the complete sets of shows and movies not just one or two
"A great app for watching shows and by the way I^m a premium member since last october and it has been a great app for me since then, but unfortunately I think there has been some ""Security Issues"" yesterday upon opening the app it suddenly logged me out also in my other device and when I enter my username and password it says incorrect password even though I^m 100% sure it is my password.It would also be great if you post what was really updated/fixed in every update you make."
It does not work correctly. Titles suddenly appeared expired if you are offline. What is the point to permit to download titles if you cannot see it when you are offline.
I don't have much to complain about this app expect why you can't use the PIP mode while in the app. Like It would be nice if you can watch a movie while you browse the next movie to watch/download. It's the only app I've seen where PIP doesn't work internally
"When I got my note 20, while watching with my wife on the phone, whenever I pause Netflix it refuses to play again unless I exit the app and select my show again. This has never happened before."
"Great features, my only negative thoughts on the netflix platform is the algorithm puts you inside a box and keeps feeding you shows and movies that match your interests supposedly and that's not always the case"
"Overall the app experience is good, but the brightness is not low enough for night. Please provide a night mode or dim light option, otherwise it strains the eye watching in night and lights off."
"Give an option to change the interface, coz the new interface is very confusing. It shows very limited items on display, the old one was better."
"ok it's good and all and i love the movies and all but there a few you know...lies that they tell you on this app.Soooo the main lie that makes me mad is the downloads.Like seriously,when i bring my phone to school,it says that you can download some movies when you dont have connection where your at, well...theres a button you can press to get to the downloads,and you have to press the button ""tap here to see all the movies you can download""well i press that and nothing and theres the lie, enjoy."
the app used to be super yet now for some reason it just gives black screen and just sounds and voices while wtaching anything! and no matter what TBS I try it doesn't fix the black screen thing! it is bad TBH
"(Edit: new layout is terrible and disorienting. Where is my ""continue watching""??) 30 sec rewind is great but there's no fastforward option when casting to my tv."
Be great if they had more of meaningful selection of movies. Most are C movies that never ever anywhere. Got a lot of foreign language films. Basically garbage. They got some really Netflix Originals though.
It's overall a good app but it's immensely frustrating that when casting it'll somehow lose connection with the chromecast and there is a total loss of control of whatever is playing
"I like Netflix, however the newer movies being released are not in English and the Netflix original series take too long to come out, and the new season of regular TV shows are never updated ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, otherwise it's ok!! Rethinking this app!!"
Over a week of the app randomly kicking me out. It's usually around the 10 minute mark of what I'm watching. I was hoping it would be resolved by now. The experience is frustrating!
"Why doesn't the picture-in-picture feature work? The video minimizes, but it's half hidden at the bottom of my phone's screen and when I try to move it, it vanishes, but the audio keeps playing."
"The app asks who is watching every time the app us opened, even if there is only one user is added in the account. Why? I don't understand the reason of this feature. Even if there are more than one users under the same account, it should remember who was watching on this device and have an option to change the user if needed."
"The app runs well, but I'm not happy that my Samsung tablet won't let me uninstall it. I keep uninstalling Netflix through Google play, but some how part of Netflix remains."
"The Netflix app lags, then while it is working there is a circle in the middle of the screen while watching, please fix it, net developer please, it's just disappointing for those who use the apps"
"I just want to remove things from my ""continue watching"" row, can not do that at all! Not on my TV, not on my laptop and not on my android phone. The help instructions say thos can only be done through the android phone app, and to click on the menu icon for the one you want to remove.... well there is not a menu icon...anywhere on this app!!!! If I am finished watching, I do not want to continue watching..."
Its an ok selection of movies and shows. The app has been very buggy lately. My shows keep pausing or will close on its own during a movie while casting.
I love Netflix but the app does have some problem sometimes it's goes black randomly it continues playing audio after I close it and alot of other things but other than those main two it very good.
This app sucks always says device failure and automatically sign out and when I sign in again FHD video playback is gone and only Sd is available on my FHD phone I got widevine L3 when it changes to SD... my phone supported widevine L1 plzz fix this issue I'm getting it more frequently this issue
"Hi there, I have a punch hole display device. Netflix dosent support full screen view leaves a chunky bar at punch hole side while youtube and other apps supports full view. Could you please fix it ASAP."
I like Netflix. but after the updates it keeps on crashing. I thinks there are some bugs on the recent update release. Till then I'm not gonna be able to watch mg fave series and dramas while on a trip üòû
"I like whatever watch on Netflix exactly at the moment. All contents are charming for me. However Turkish Government wants to apply a licence process and it contains some limitations for users, not for Netflix. Because Netflix earn money again whatever they publish. But audience's are watching some censor's which is the screen in the natural flow that could be cigarette or a whole censored glass with alcohol or non of sex screen. Maybe they won't publish whole contents some of series or movies."
"It's alright It's alright but you keep removing lote of movies that are very interesting for people and that just gets me frustrated and there are not alote of seasons /not all the season are there and I would really,you appreciate if you put all the seasons and episodes please."
"Is it good netflix but you guys are going to start charging us 17$ per month now? There's like showbox, cyberlink, etc of apps that are FREE and yet BETTER than netflix and you can download for free and have way more options than Netflix! You guys are going to lose more and more costumers. I only have Netflix for some of my friends who don't have androids. Either way ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Netflix Downloading speed problem... Netflix App Is great that another otp platform.. but i am facing One problem whenever i am downloading something the netflix app downloding is very slow this is not my internet problem because i have been always checking my internet speed my internet speed is very fast....Plzz fix this problem then i will give 5 star Ratingssüëåüèª
the brightness becomes maximum automatically when i play any movie on my redmi k20 pro. the brightness remains full even after reducing it from settings. this happens only while using Netflix. please look into the matter.
UI is not that friendly. Can't get rid of foreign language films. Hard to get rid of continue watching. And need an option to get rid of shows rated and watched. Basic needs.
Hey I am watching the series of this app app I am just found out that some episodes or seasons are missing for example I am watching one of my favourite series Dragons race to the edge it has only four seasons but I found out that it has total Six Seasons please upload the all the Seasons so I can watch and enjoy the app
Add volume controls and forward skip on Phone-to-TV viewing widget
Consistently plays audio only when picture freezes or screen is black. Issue only in app on mobile devices and not tv etc. Means have to reload all the time andcant just put shows on
"As much as I love using netflix, this app came pre-installed on my phone and I can't seem to fully uninstall it. It just keeps reappearing on my phone using up valuable space."
Expected more in its content. Very limited for the price. Great that you can often choose your own language in audio/subtitles for foreign films.
I am having issues playing videos at 1080 on my Chromebook and the videos also stutters. It looks pixelated and snowy on most Netflix movies and shows. Plz fix. Thank You.
"It's ok, very easy to use, great quality, there's a download function. But the content is quite bad, old content, bad series, where is all the movies?"
"It used to be comfortable changing devices, since the last watch episode will resume. But now it's a bit strange, if I alter to a different device, the last watch will play again from the start üòµ"
"Screen unlock not working. After I forward the video for 10 secs, the pause options do not clear when I click on the screen again. I have tried reinstalling also. Doesn't work."
Netflix is a great app but there are many shows that I couldn't access. Make all the shows and movies accessible even if you're not from that certain country.
"Connecting to a Chromecast from outside a show/movie seems to work, but once I start a movie or show I have to re-connect, as it plays automatically from my phone."
"Good app, good shows, but the random glitches and errors that happen every week or 2 require re- installing which is kinda annoying? Fix these problems and its gold"
For users with google smart lock issue: Go to Chrome > Settings> Passwords > Turn off 'Save passwords' option then Uninstall and reinstall Netflix. It should direct you to the log-in page again. It worked for me!
"The movie content is good but the app is suppose to work with Samsung Dex and that doesn't happen. Therefore, you can't watch it at full screen."
Very disappointed that I can not down load movies to my phone to watch at a later date. Wish I never updated!!!!! Very disappointing!!!! Please fix the bug!!!!!
"Bring back your Netflix font on subtitles. I hate the new update, the subtitles just got a little bigger than before and uses the system font instead of the Netflix font."
"The irritating new netflix ads are extremely off putting. Going to switch soon if they don't get rid of them! I have hulu and prime and this doesnt cut it. Ads stay, i leave!"
"You have added smart download option, where app itself downloads content as per your algorithm. Please add option to auto download content that we have save in 'My list'. This way, app user can watch content that is already on their wish list."
"I usually enjoy Netflix, but lately all the new content is foreign films or tv shows that have been dubbed in English, or pedophilia related! And the prices keep going up... If this keeps going on I will be cancelling my membership."
"compared to other similar apps, this has slooooow server response (for the pricey monthly family plan we avail) thinking of ending our family subscription at the end of the year if there are no improvements. recurrent problems in ""opening"" the app despite our updated gadget/mobile."
Netflix is good but when i was watching anime i found out that a lot of anime series' are not complete in netflix. There are a lot of non uploaded episodes that I had to find from other sources. Consider fixing these errors üôÇ
"actually I really want to subscribe to this application, but for people like me who don't use a credit card or debit card it's very troublesome for me. so please help so that everyone who wants to subscribe can have the option to pay with credit from a telephone operator"
It's great app but the problem here in middle East it needs to be paid with credit card. I hope we can pay with via top up (with phone sim payment like in games so it's accessible for every one) please notice me every one i know is hoping for this
"This app is great except for the fact that it lags a lot. Some days I cant watch any show, regardless of internet connection, app being updated, and restarting the device"
I really love netflix but it keeps on crashing. I need to restart my phone then everything that I downloaded would be deleted. I have to uninstall then reinstall and download again. please fix this. thank you
"why on most of the movies I am grttingn glitches , the video is not getting rendered properly. my net speed is good , only able to hear the sound but the pictures frames are not geeting rendered properly kindly look into this."
"The series are incomplete in anime category as in Bleach, Gintama etc. Kindly upload all the seasons of the anime. If they are incomplete it's really irritating and you'll end up losing the subscriptions."
"The app used to be great, I don't like the new preview experience, it only occupies a small portion of the screen and ads extra click. Also, recommends shows I have already watched, why?"
Hi i cant play video while on fone call Can please tell me the solution
Works great. But lately while watching the movies/dramas the sound suddenly gets lower & mute. Pressed back and restart the apps/device the problem keeps on happening.
The app is good but am not having a good experience on it at all. I subscribed twice already now and money has been deducted from my bank account twice and I can't do anything on the app it keeps telling me that my account is on hold. I really want something to be done asap pleaseüôè. I don't know if i have been scammed or not but I need the money or the log in.
"After the update, most of the downloads when opened, keep loading and some even won't open. Please fix this issue because it is affecting the user experience negatively, thanks."
I enjoyed the app but it gave me audio only option and it doesnt show up anymore for me. I really liked it because i could listen to a show while i worked but now i cant without using my phone battery up.
I like the easy set up and use of the app. I would give 5 stars if the content was better. I'm paying to stream movies mainly and the selection is dated. Unfortunate.
"Not sure if this is intentional or a bug. When I have minimized the app and playing a game with adverts on another screen, the app freezes or blanks out. :-(."
It will not let me watch the full video without pausing the video and still playing the audio. Basically the video freezes and the audio resumes.
"Very hard to sync log in info, price rate went up but cannot get even the simplest programs. Not crazy about the ""new"" choices but it's already been paid for so I'll keep trying for now."
"streaming service is excellent. But, whole cast details are not available. i.e, in prime video cast is displayed along the scenes and general trivia is also given.Netflix should implement the same."
"The netflix app is so buggy, as I'm typing this review, I am somehow streaming a movie right now to my tv, from netflix, with the app fully uninstalled, lol. It's actually really funny."
"I dont have the ability to take things of of watch later, what if I accidently click on a show? I have to watch it all the way even if it is my least favorite one plus they dont remove things, If I havent watched something in two months let me find it again on my OWN"
"love it.. but fix the crashed..its annoying! and i will give 5 star back to you. its not my phone surely, cause i have bigger game on the phone but did not crashed tho, played for many hours than a movie could handle."
It's an okay experience the thing I hate most is that there are anime only Netflix with only few seasons and no dub ENG audio even though the anime is extremely old like Naruto
Need more newer movies and TV series. Should I for discounts and promotions for people who use this app and site on a regular basis. Would like to have surveys done on what type of content you watch often to add those options to your list more often in on the site
Netflix lost alot of good stuff but I'm a huge Star trek fan and appreciate what they have wish they had more. The netflix original could have more rated R horror but in all genres the netflix original material for the most part is great. More quality horror needed.
I get frusterated with how long it takes to open sometimes. Or that I have to uninstall and reinstall for it to actually load. But great shows and movies!
There is no option to filter or configure to show content only if it have audio in defined language. Same for the subtitles. The rest is good.
"Well at the moment it isn't working, network down, I'll try l8r and reply back..."
"The experience is good so far especially with the download option to be able to watch offline, we will appreciate if we could have more of the latest movies more than series."
My app is crashing when I open it. It's been three weeks now. All i do is uninstall and install it in order for me to open the app. Help this get fix please. I didn't pay for it just to keep repeating in uninstalling.
Needs some updated movies yet. I still stop back to check if there is anything new but it's not often that there's much that is new and exciting. My worst rating is the HORROR selections! Which are my favorites to watch. That rating is only a 1‚≠ê at most times. Keep trying to get better at what your doing and I may return more often.
I gave it three stars because well my internet is perfect but it won't load properly and also you don't have all the seasons of my favorite shows and I know they're on there because I see them on like other apps so I really think you should fix that because people want to watch their Seasons but they can't find it cuz they don't have it and it's really annoying because I want to watch season 4 of Attack on Titan but I can't because I don't have it
Netflix works fine on my cell. My tv not so good. Keeps stopping. I have been nursing it along and turning it on with some struggle. Im not keeping Netflix to watch on my phone. Is there an update that would help?
There are not a lot of choice in movies to watch.Animated movies can be added more and latest movies should also be added if you are demanding such price for a month so that it would be value for money.Otherwise a good jobüòÑüòÑ
"I do not like how bright the screen automatically gets when I use this app on my phone. I should be able to control the brightness myself, but the screen automatically sets to very bright, despite what I set it as on my phone."
It's great when it is working. I have been trying to watch a show and it keeps freezing. The audio keeps going but the visual just freezes.
"I've had no problems with this app until today. Since the last update the video doesn't rotate so I'm stuck watching videos vertically. I've done everything possible but it hasn't worked, can't watch anything atm"
"OK, there needs to be a forward button..maybe 15-20 seconds. That would help prevent certain scenes to be bypassed, the ones that are unexpected. Thanks"
"I'm on a Samsung A52, fully capable of HD playback and even HDR. The app, however, shows max playback is only SD. It downloads SD even when it's set to HD in settings. It's very noticeable, and grossly unpleasant."
"Whenever I go to a different app, I get logged out of netflix. Really frustrating to have to log back in every time I do something else on my phone while watching a show."
It's a good app that allows you to watch movies and shows easily and quickly but if you don't have a VPN you can't get all the movies and considering I'm paying I believe I should be able to watch all the movies Netflix has to offer.
"This new UI... oof. Hard to find anything, unable to just browse. You broke the casting functionality. This needs a rollback, hard. If this is the new format, may reduce the $ i pay for users per month."
Recently.. Seems there is a bug in app. Even downloaded episodes doesnt play. It keeps showing loading. Please update the app. Rest everything is perfect.
"Great when it works but at least 30% of the time, before I can continue playing, I have to force close & data clearance or do a full uninstall/reinstall in order to keep watching a show."
"App works fine, how hard would it be to just add in the language of the movie on the description. Also take movies of the menu if they have been watched and it would be a great app."
How do I reset my Netflix back to my beginning 5 + years ago when they asked me to pick something to watch I might of pick a movie not in english because I'm getting about 5 other language types of movies and tv shows I'm literate I don't do reading all writing much all at alll this is spellcheck. So this year 65% if what I'm getting is foreign and all have an English title with different language's.My kids like Netflix alot an I'd like to to all do I keep my money (Reset Button) Please üòä
"Why does my screen keep turning green?  Why does the sound go away when I'm watching my shows?  Why does my screen shrink and move to the right hand corn of my TV? This is a daily problem, happening many times a day. This i isn't good for a service that we are paying for. Please help with this issue."
I would like it if Max from Stranger Things can be added as an icon for the mobile app. Tried changing it on desktop and had no idea why it wasn't working. This can't be that hard to update.
"After the new update, for some reason the brightness going crazy. Even I set my phone brightness to very low, Netflix ramp it up to max. Please fix this issue. My eyes got hurt when I tired to watch a series yesterday night because of this brightness issue."
I absolutely love using Netflix but when I watch TV shows like Men on a mission if I'm watching season 2 episode 1 it will go back to season 1 and keep on going down until I'm back at episode 1 for season 1 I would like to know if there is a way I can change that or if you guys could change it.
"After software update, don't know why my downloaded files are not playing, new files are also not downloading! It is showing I have my account opened in another device. But I have not used this account in any other account. Now it is saying to remove my account from another device which I have no idea about! What should I do now?"
In order to increase subscribers. Please add international movies and shows on regional dubbed language. Bcoz in India hindi is not the only language spoken. So kindly increase dubbed movies. There are lot more good movies but it is in only English and Hindi.
"When watching something on Netflix, the app continuously takes me back to the home page after having watched a show for a maximum of 10 minutes, it then kicks me off what I'm watching."
The app is good but can you continue the movies like there's a number of movies I've watched that the complete season is not on Netflix... Please arthdal chronicles we need the season 2
"Usually when i open the app the error code ""-1023"" pops up, i have to open the recent apps tab close Netflix and reopen it. In Hungary there are less movies available than other countries."
"It's been great since bt my issues began yesterday, y'all telling me that I'm using vpn or proxy bt I'm not Again I can stream bt I can't download, how?? Do something guys, it's really frustrating Another thing, why would you guys keep other movies and shows for certain countries only, fuhk"
The platform is fine but the app keeps buffering when you play something online. Idk if it's a problem with a new update or what. But please fix it. I've been disconnecting and connecting my wifi.
"The app was great, I would give it five stars. Something went wrong, probably with the last update. I am having problems. When choosing a video to play it signs me out and I have to sign in again. Please fix this problem."
"When will you finally introduce the choice of resolution? 150 MBPS internet, full HD tablet and watching in higher SD, not cool. Old review: Good, large choice of movies and series, but I do not understand why some shows are still only in SD quality in 2019. Like the second Witcher episode. Believe me, my internet is fast enough..."
"It's ok but compared to watching videos on Plex and YouTube, Netflix is the worst. I wish I could mark an episode as ""Watched"" and that I could also fast forward a video like Plex or YouTube?!?"
"3 stars,because I am a big fan of Star wars. And if they had it,it would get 4 stars. The only other problem is that some movies and series are only limited and GUYS! why do you have something like a very long series that is limited but when you are at season 2,episode 16 and there are 5 seasons the next day your series is gone. Like why? But over all I like the fact that you can download movies and episode's. I love Netflix ‚ù§. üëç"
"Sometimes most watched movies/series not updating . Also hard to fine the movie or series , not populating even searching each Genres. Already updated , cleared cache and data. Same issue."
"I'm tired of every time my grandson gets ready to watch a program he has to send me a text to update it in order for it to come back on. It never does that on his cellphone. Before this, my family really enjoyed Netflix"
"I used to love this but then when I renew my subscription and updated the apps, it cannot be opened anymore. Had to use the web instead. Really really frustrating. Hope the team fix this."
Very good movies once a month. South Africa does not have access to full range movies without having to access via expensive international VPN. Too many series and outdated movies.
I would give 5 stars but I seen an article that the witcher may get cancelled if so I will drop it to one star and be done with Netflix as well as my families. We all love that show and have been waiting for season 2. Netflix will lose at least 5 more accounts then that I know of myself. And im sure we wont be the only ones.
"Unfulfilling. I wish NETFLIX could just allow me search for the season or part I want to watch, without necessarily starting to download from season 1. E.g, I have watched season 1,2,3 of Good doctor and deleted them because of space but I can't watch or download season 4 because Netflix does not support that. This is frustrating. So many series I have watched but can't watch the remaining or concluding part because No option for that. This is so unfair. PLEASE FIX , thanks."
I loved this app and the Netflix series are amazing I thought that I will give this app 5 stars but when I downloaded a Netflix series protector and I saw that the downloaded episode s were not having the option of hindi as audio but if I see other episode of that series from the same season online which episode I have not downloaded then it is working with hindi audio I request Netflix to please fix this problem to make the experience more interesting that's why I am now giving 3 stars.
"Everything is very good except the payment methods, there are only few types of debit cards are available. you guys don't accept 'rupee' cards, so please make every card available including UPI payment method. i have a rupee card right now but i can't update my payment, which is a disappointment! please update payment options."
"Netflix was the 1st streaming service subscription I signed up to so I was happy for the 1st month. Cool If you like historic documentaries, really any educational programs you will be disappointed fast with Netflix. :( Hulu has 100√ós more content"
Removing stuff from my list can be way too stressful especially when you have a lot of stuff you scroll down a bit Remove one thing and it catapults you all the way back to the top. Should make it easier to remove stuff from list
"sometimes i have to reinstall the app because videos wont stream or its just a black screen with audio. might be an issue with my phone though. other than that, good, taylor swift documentary <3"
The app is amazing when it works. But currently whenever I try to watch something from the app the audio of the movie plays but nothing can be seen other than a black screen.
Its great overall just that they take good anime off and I'm on English Netflix so there's not much options and when I change my VPN to American Netflix they are taking hxh and Ouran high school host club so if it had more variations in anime and many downloads for not much data then I would give it 5 stars
"Netflix wants you to sign up on their service to order a TV show that it says it has on live stream, but if you sign up and cant find the show there no options and you are tuck with a service that cant provide what ou want. needs fixing"
The platform is amazing and I love watching but sometimes I get an error -1001 and my app doesn't open at all although I watch on my tv and laptop and there it works perfectly but I still get upset as it doesn't work on my phone suddenly.
Every time i move forward or backward by 10 secs the audio and video stop syncing. This has been happening since new update. Please look into it.
It sometimes tells me that there's an error with my connection when it's perfectly working. Sometimes Netflix has its own error when it just doesn't want to work
Plz make app to purchase the plan with upi I'd also. Many don't carry cards all the time and it is annoying to only pay the bill with card while all other app can have upi payments now a days plz do it fast it would be great if you do in next update!
Honestly its great idk what the other people had as a problem but i never had one and i think they could lower the price because it doesnt bring much for the price as other apps
"Offerings are fine. Lately though, the time keeper is stuck on zero even as the program plays normally. Impossible to drag to a time point."
Shows are good. But sometimes video gets stuck and audio keeps continuing!
"My app isn't starting. All other apps are working. My internet connection is also stable. But when I open it, it just shows Netflix and nothing then.. It stays on juat that screen."
Netflix was good years ago when younger. Now it barely has any thing interesting and feels over priced for how little cobrent their is. The app hasnt even even hot many of the latest movies anime or tv series and puts random series or movies up claiming their trending but theyre not.
"C'mon, need pay an extra bill to have the feature to use the account in others devices at the same time. This is crazy, but is not a bad streaming platform at all"
Majority of the time when you press the back button to go back to the main page while you're watching a show it shuts the app off. I have to close down the app and re open it to get to the main page.
"I'm eagerly waiting for the Mobile+ plan which has been launched by Netflix for Indian viewers, I would really appreciate if anyone can tell me when it will be available. The content on Netflix is good and I look forward to be a viewer with the Mobile+ plan. Thank you!"
Videos are lagging a lot and it's annoying.
Great app but the new interface is annoying. Please can it be reversed. Searching for movies is now difficult. I don't even understand the interface.
"Netflix picture quality good to cheap rate .. but I have one issue ... With Netflix last month my recharge expired, I was open Netflix i didn't click to pay .. my card details already . Have it .. but it's on one's own recharged... Automatically, that's was not good..."
Netflix is really the best of the best but I HATE when my bill is due and the company is constantly trying to take money from my account when I have more urgent matters to take care of like yesterday I left my card enabled to get something important and all of a sudden I see a charge on my account when clearly I wasn't ready like.. give your users THE CHOICE to pay the bill NOT when you FEEL like they need to pay the bill.
"Idk about you all, but I'm going to stop paying Netflix due to always canceling great shows. Half the time the movies the play are boring, and old. üñï with the wack shows, and Movies"
I love netflix but someone needs to fix the lag and the glitching that's on the new update it's getting really annoying when you try to watch movie or show and it glitches or stops during the beginning or middle
Love the content available but when casting from my phone it drains a LOT of battery. It continues to run in the background the entire time it's casting. Please fix this!
"I usually LOVE this app UNTIL lately! NOW when I try to watch Netflix, it will buffer for 20 mins. BEFOR it will bring up a show I have been watching for weeks! It is crazy that what DOES come on immediately is a whole list of movies and shows to PREVIEW. WHAT has been going on NETFLIX???"
"The app for Android is great! The app for Samsung smart TVs also great! But Netflix on a Windows PC is crazy slow and laggy! Yes, they're all updated etc."
I don't understand why I can't use HD on my phone when I'm paying a 4K subscription and my phone is not rooted. Other service providers allow HD on my phone. Why do Netflix make their app so annoying
"Bug in download section, it seems to appear triple transparent layers stacked together which makes me unable to read anything clearly. Other than that, no issue at all. Nice!"
"Really bad to handle episodes. Buttons outside of the screen so no way to press them. Menus not friendly. A lot of potential, but instead of improving I see app getting worst."
"Hi, Since the update I can't seem to access Netflix, be it on the website or app. If we access it through website, we were getting the error "" site cannot be reached. If we used the app, error is "" Can't connect to Netflix"". Its been like this for 2 days now. I know its not our internet connection coz I dont have any problem accessing other sites like youtube, facebook.,etc. Please fix it. We just made our payment last july 15, so our sibscription is also updated."
Netflix is a very good app to watch movies but takes up a lot of space and also whenever you want to search up the movie you want to watch a search up different things and does not go straight to the movie you want
Slowly losing stars because of constant price increases. What started out as an excellent service and pricing is slowly becoming quite the opposite. Soon going to cancel my subscription.
"Honestly i think that netflix should spend more of their time getting more episodes and seasons in already existing shows like henry danger, grey's anatomy and, one day at a time than getting series nobody asked for like winx, dark desire, etc. If ya'll can spend time on good shows rather than the bad, i'd give it 5 stars (ps. WHY IS THERE NO 1st SEASON OF ""MY HERO ACADEMIA"")"
"I would have given Netflix a 5 star rating but a 3 is as best right now. First, everytime I go to view ANY title, the screen darkens. I have checked my settings and it is nothing in there that would cause this. Can someone tell WHAT is going on?"
"With Covid ,,,,,no work ,, the wife's suv garage didn't titin oil filter,so engine sized ,I gave her my suv ,everything is to far to walk so I'm at home with Netflix ,broke it's been years without Netflix (saving a dime) I gotta say not like cable( I'm not bent )(the shows are new )( I'm truly entertained) I no the ruff patch is here to stay !!!!!! thanks for the free month NETFLIX and thank you for making this time better with your selection of great shows we will make it till times are better!"
This app is to be upgraded l can see some issues on tab. This app works fine on my mobile phone but not working on my galaxy tab the app is getting crashed. Hope you look into this issue.
"New opening Leaving netflix soon screen when I first turn the app on, makes the app not work on my roku TV. It will not allow me to continue to the next screen, as the option will not select."
Hey there is a bug that makes the app crash or the phone to restart whenever I play a video on my realme x7. Kindly look into it. It's very frustrating.
"Why has the brightness on Netflix stopped working. Like even when I've got the brightness on full on the side, it doesn't brighten up that much. It never used to be like that."
love this app on my firestick but when I tried to log in from my phone it would not allow it. I have my passwords saved and I've had it since I establish the account. so there's no way I got the password wrong.
Display is irritating. I cannot see some of the shows because the screen is dark. I've tried changing it on my phone but like the other user I get a message that another app is controlling brightness. What is up with that? Where is the option to remove it?
"The app is amazing and awesome!,but the new look is really disturbing to the eyes and once it freezes there's gonna be a big problem.Apart from that the app is wonderful."
"I love the service and the app, but that auto play feature is the worst! I don't want to watch a trailer of every single movie when I'm trying to scroll to a specific movie. Instead, could you guys write better summaries and let us actually read the whole thing instead of only writing a sentence or blocking half?"
It's great but the video playback section has a problem on my android phone. Clicking on video only hides the brightness slider instead of all the playback menu items.
Having issues with the controls showing up on my lock screen when using Chromecast. It reverts to the original android control setup but Netflix is unresponsive to the controls.
"Their selection is meh to say the least. Their Netflix originals mostly seem to be half of a story, but not like the first or end half, just the middle part. Hulu and Amazon are better."
"It's quite annoying that if a movie is paused and the app is in the background, once an instant message arrives (or a notification) + the movie starts playing again ((."
"I have to move this app to my SD card after download. Once I do that it no longer operates. I need the space because of old phone, I have no money for a new phone. I know you don't care I just wanted to calmly rant. Rant over."
"Good app but awful brightness bar on the side. Please get rid of it, we can increase the brightness by using the proper tablet option. The brightness goes up while holding the tablet all the time and it can harm the eyes. It need to be constantly monitored when used by children or people with disabilities. How do I disable it!!!"
"I don't know whats wrong with the app, i updated the app, tried unistalling and installing still it doesnt nor i can download, it say problem in network connection, but i have no problem with my internet. Its so annoying. I dont even wanna give any rating to thia app, it way too worst"
"Almost the best streaming app, except that its easily hacked. I can see a lot of unfamiliar sign ins on my account even after changing the password regularly. I hope you can do something about security."
"Android 13 Samsung device/tablet, does not allow storage to SD Card on device. This issue has been reported on forums since February 2023. Otherwise a perfectly functional app, but this issue is a large annoyance."
Outstanding but there should be an option to cut off or erase ur watching history because sometimes we share it with our other family members and the content is 18+ so then they are watching what u have watched. So if that issue could be fix. Thank you.
I have been using Netflix for less than a month and what I have noticed is ..there isn't much options ...i would suggest adding house md series Grey's anatomy and more ...add regional movies as well ...after all its a paid app ...i find Amazon prime better
"I love the APK, but why no make it possible to transfer download from one device to another with thesame acc for security reasons, I downloaded some movies and now my phone speaker is bad, I need to redownload these movies in my pc for me to be able to watch It's all just such a drag!!!, I hope u guyz can make it possible for me to transfer my downloaded videos to another device with thesame Netflix acc"
This most recent update has been ruining my experience the app keeps kicking me out saying that there's an issue. I've had to rely on other streaming apps to watch my shows.
The reason I have put a low rating because.. I don't know how but.... My money is transacted from my bank account without my consent just because I have link along with my account... This is very inappropriate.... Money should be transacted only on someone's consent and approval and not through automatic transaction...this is almost like burglary!!!!!
"it freezes too often. Used to pay for it because the movies played so smoothly now might as well stop and use another app, if it gonna be just the same as the others may as well continue with the others."
"Hard to complain about the app in general, but a recent update has placed the ""play something"" button in a location that partially covers media controls on Android mobile."
"Movie watching, a 5-star. 3-star is because my app doesn't allow full control of my Account... especially and specifically, my viewing history. We live in 2023... surely that feature can be added. It's a free service. We do pay monthly fees."
UI/UX is very poor and perplexed. There is no landscape mode all the time for mobile devices. Everytime need to rotate from landscape to portrait while shuffling contents.
"Thanks for the minimum mobile subscription plan, much appreciated. But why fo I have to choose account everytime I open the app? Even when there's only one account It always prompt to choose account. Why? This problem is been there for way too long. Please solve this."
Great! Except once opened it will not close in the background once I am done using the app. So basically I can't close out the app that's the only issue.
"I've subscribed for standard plan. But the videos are dreaming only HD or Full HD. Even in the app setting the current plan was mentioned as Standard HD, When I checked with customer care they are telling that my mobile is not compatible to watch the video is Full Hd."
"it's ok, I just wish that it would stop overriding my brightness settings when watching sonething. I've downloaded an app just for this reason and it used to work before, but now it doesn't. it's really annoying me (and my eyes at night) :/"
"I'm connected in the US (VPN off), Netflix connects me to an international server; I really just want to finish watching The Good Place before it goes away. [FIXED] I just removed the account and made a new one, which turns out fine for now"
"Just updated it last night, and now every video has subtitles, and you have to shut them off each time. Other than that, netflix is good."
"I can't even open the Netflix anymore. How come all my apps works perfectly fine while on Netflix, ""sorry we can't reach Netflix service "". Please can you fix this."
The set up got fixed so that's good I can actually find my shows again. I'm not a big fan of Netflix having its own brightness setting though its inconvenient in my opinion.
Didn't think it was streaming in ultra HD. But when I downloaded using win10 app it was still not up to the standards.. Each episode was around 700MBs..why don't you allow download in ultra HD or HD.. Atleast 1080p.
"I find Malaysia Netflix n which ever contries that share the same limited movies that we have are kind of useless. Let put it this way, 70% of the movie I search is not in Netflix. And to be fair I dont search for new blockbuster movies. But out of those 70%, 65% of them are in Netflix US. Are we some kind of 3rd world countries that dont deserve good shows? We paid more than you guys in US and Europe."
Overall it's a good app but customer support needs a lot of improvement. Titles across the globe should be available in all counties. A lot of the titles are only available region wise which is bad
While watching a movie or an episode if I receive a video call on Whatsapp the movie does not start from the point before the call next time. Its very annoying.
"The subtitles are totally white, if the background is clear you can't read the subtitles. Bad choose of color. There's no option to change the subtitles color."
Netflix please on behalf of all Netflix members please bring us new kdrama series please we are missing a lot and all our hope are on you Netflix üôè
"Make a better Search function. When I search, and I select a movie cover, Netflix doesn't show any info about that. At least make a pop up with some info like genre, short story ? A trailer would be amazing, but I guess I am asking too much...."
Whenever I close and open the app it is giving some error code. I think Netflix has to fix this. Now I have to switch off and on the phone then only it works
"I have a problem, when I want to watch a movie or an episode, my phone (Galaxy S7 Edge) restarts itself, and when I reopen the application, sometimes its walk, sometimes no. is it possible to solve it"
Custom brightness implementation is broken. The selection bar is too small and interferes with system brightness when using picture in picture mode and pausing/playing.
"I usually like Netflix but for the past few days, the app won't open. I even tried re-installing, but the screen stays stuck on the NETFLIX symbol page. Please fix this, because I don't think I'm the only one."
Good app. I think more volume output would be nice. Also a remove option in the continue watching section. Sometimes one loses interest and doesn't want to see unfinished seasons on there forever. Thanks!
Can please remove the brightness setting at the side of the video? It is irritating and doesn't work on minimising video. Also can increase speed up video to 2.0.would be helpful.
"Netflix is a helpful app...my only complaint is that because of copyright issues, in some countries you can't get everything u want...so maybe use Google Movies instead You've an get things for less than a dollar."
It's keeps on buffering. Not able to watch any new series or movie. Not even playing the next episode. My internet speed is good only as all the apps are working properly.
"Not all series is downloadable, some series have another season going but Netflix won't add it, and some series start in the middle (e.g. starts on season 13 and ends on season 17 , family guy) and the word is when it is rated a certain age but won't tell you why, unless you go into the movie, and even then it won't tell you all of them. Plz fix"
"Overall i think this is a great application, but i do think it is over priced considering you hardly find the more popular movies or series, or you start watching a series and they lose the license."
needs to get more American programs
Netflix is a family favorite. It use to be worth the money. We can watch it on the go with the app. The price is outrageous. Netflix shouldn't make their paying customers pay for their free customers. TMobile needs to pay.
Streaming is perfect but Rewind and fast-forward is very slow. It's very frustrating to wait while fast-forward and rewind. It should be fast
Some times it just shut off and don't start at times. I don't know why all other apps are running easily in my phone but this app don't run whether it's WiFi or mobile data.
"After the new update, when using the sliding bar to skip, it doesn't pop up a scene associated with it. This use to be so helpful. Please bring it back for the next update."
"Long time customer, finally fed up with the lack of watchable content being added. Netflix is the streaming equivalent of Walmart's discount bin. I would advise that you take your money and put it towards HBO MAX, or Hulu. Canceling subscription after 6 years."
"Great stuff to watch movies and shows on but once when I was a kid I found this Indian culture series and I loved it it was called krish Trish and boltyboy , but soon after that they removed it and no channel has it , now I can only watch it on YouTube with the episodes not finishing and it doesn't have English or my favorite episode, Netflix please try to change this ."
Interface is too good and lot of series and movies available that will be good entertainment but they need to provide audio request option every movie or series. Few of them only available in hindi. Most of South indian people doesn't know hindi. Based on user request you guys can add dedicated language right. Please do consider this.
"Great until it wasnt! It never remembers where I am in a series, never mind an episode. My list has dissapeared and so has the continue watching section. Meaning I have to search to pick up a series I've already started watching. Dissapointing."
"I have instaled this app plenty of times and its worked amazingly, but now when i try and pick a email to get in it just closes and when i try amd watch tv shows or movies that i've downloaded a message comes up as error or offline."
I keep getting error (-1001) every time I open the app on my android phone. The app used to function perfectly fine. This was my favorite app. I'd give it five stars if the issue was resolved. Perhaps release an update that would resolve the issue.
"I love the shows and the app works fine on the TV but on phone, everytime I watch a show, it keeps returning to the home page. I'm so sick of it, it started since they included the blackpink movie."
Netflix what happen? Can't open your App I've been encountering errors everytime to Open it. -1023 please fix it. Ever since it was updated been having hard time Opening it always shows an Error.
You really need to give us the option of forcing the app to follow the system's brightness and not the other way around. The app keeps activating the captions on its own as well.
Recently the video gets stuck when forwarding or going back. It is very annoying. The audio continues however the video gets completely stuck everytime.
"Netflix keeps getting rid of shows I like to the point I'll just end up canceling my subscription. What next, commercials? I can't believe you got rid of New Girl. I'm at the point where I'm just going to start buying hardcopies again. It's like we're going backwards."
"App is so full of promoted material I can't ever find ""my list"" or ""continue watching."" Netflix is so busy trying to promote that they forgot (or just don't care) what the customer actually wants."
The TV app doesn't have any option to change or reduce the video quality to lower tp reduce data usage. Too bad. Learn something from youtube. The best app on TV and moBile.
"Netflix is a cool thing, but here in Iceland, it is sooo limited... it is not worth the price compared how few movies shows and series you get.. we want the USA version!"
This last version (jan2019) is buggy. streaming doesn't work on the first click and often I have to start the show in my phone before steam (this wasn't the behavior before the update)
"Fix the subtitles of anime series, It's hard to read some part of the subtitles because it's all white. Put some black outline or background just like on the movies. Not watching anymore animes on netflix until its fixed."
"Please stop hiding search results. If I search for a category, it clearly means that I want to see all in the category. Filtering should be done as a choice later, not the other way around like it currently stands."
I can't take pictures and record videos. but sometimes it can only be done for a few dramas/movies and the saddest thing is that I was able to take a screenshot while in the middle of the episode and not the first episode. I also can't share dramas or movies on my instagram stories :) and sorry for my bad english
"Something happened with the new update, the video is now so dark I literally can't even watch the show. Previously, I loved the app and all its features. In the last 24 hours, it's become unusable."
"using an older version because i'm using an older phone... but recently i'm unable to watch anymore because it says to use the app on a phone but i'm already using my phone... just need a clarification if the app doesn't support older android version... if i can't fix it, maybe i should just beg my way to have a new phone..."
Don't need updates for your new fast laughs feature. Not a fan of the fast laugh feature. I have turned off all notifications for the application due to the unnecessary notifications from the fast laugh aspect of Netflix. Thank you.
"full feature netflix is a very expensive monthly subscription..auto-debit setup on cards is very difficult in india,but netflix wont change itself..to know next debit of monthly fee,app sends to account page which is not opening at all..often,it is so confusing what to watch..indian regional language collection is not big enough"
"If you made it so I could use my phone as a remote so I was able 2 then stream it to my TV via my playstation, like you are able to with Spotify and YouTube then would happily give it 5* until that happens can't give a better rating"
"The app is okay, but it crashes at least one time everytime I start to watch something. Then I have tp reopen the app and try again. This is a 2019 phone, common."
"Not enough change in movies. Legends of the Fall, Chasing Mavericks, A River Runs Through It, etc. etc. etc. are never on Netflix. Why not more great classics?????"
"Worst thing is that downloaded movies/series keep on loading and don't play, don't know the reason but fix this. This is the one thing downgrading Netflix."
"Whats with the playback controls from the last few updates? Its so sluggish n unresponsive. If this was an intentional change, then it was a pretty stupid one"
"When I'm playing something, the play button doesn't go off when I click, it goes off only on its own and it's frustrating to skip 10 seconds everytime and waiting."
Sometimes this app just don't seem to work well with my phone. I hope this will he addressed. My phone is always updated but the app always crashes for some reason that I don't understand.
It's an ok streaming service and it could be an even better streaming service if it was more upto date and had a wider range of movies for example the marvel universe you don't have any of the good ones the ones people want to see so for that reason it's only a 3 star review
problems about the video not starting and stuff I had to restart 5 times until I decided to reinstall it worked again and now it happened yet again its not very big but its still an inconvenience that can keep a happy costumer binging
I am watching a show and it keeps freezing. When I click off of the show and click on it it has no problems. And then a few minutes later it does the same thing. Please fix this
The tv show at my watch list keeps showing episodes that i already watched they start from the beginning so every time i have to go and select the right episode this shouldn't happen i watch to the credits i updated and reinstalled but still happening fix it.
It's ok... Crazy bandwith usage. Not even half a movie will eat a 4gb service plan like hot cakes... And way too man updates. Every time i plug my phone in(everyday) there's an update. Its netflix tho and works great over wifi.
"I used Netflix, watching shows was a good experience,but my account got hacked, tried to contact Netflix help,but not even able to connect,was not expecting this,be aware while using we are not safe as we think"
Yo I haven't even watch the shows that I downloaded but it had expired and now I can't re-download it. Annoying how u don't allow people to re-download stuff that they want to watch repeatedly.
Mines been playing up as well. It keeps freezing and then you can't skip forward or backward. I've uninstalled and installed.. glad its not just mine on my phone. Please fix !
The app is fantastic can't lie about that giving it a 3stars. Have been using free plan for more than 3months now üòÄ one thing that is frustrating sometimes when you one to download an episode it won't download it can take even a day unless you start contacting the helpline plz check on that only.
"Please, add high definition choice for mobile. Some shows look like they were made even before youtube had button to choose quality. I liked the interface overall, though"
"Okay last offer, The game is stealing the better...ü§ßWell it was a bit more fun to me when i doenload it again in Google 'Netflix apk' I was happy back then i think the game is still in confusing method.But i think the creator is giving it a chance to provent the changes,Like watching Babysitter like that or more like anything to mass with......But i think the game is making better and better [BUT STILL NOT REALLY GOOD] to me ;)"
"After logging in to my account..it shows all my devices..It says installed on my two mobiles..including tablet...but I have no App on tablet..trying to install again, but it shows that App already installed.. which is not.. and  it's just never ending story.. all over again and around..what the heck is this....? Any clues please?"
"Netflix. We need to talk, so I wanted to watch gumball season 4,5 and 6 with my kids but theres not even any bruh. All I see is gumball season 1,2 and 3 PLEASE STOP BEING A LAZY LITTLE MAN. and the thing that makes me very mad is that they removed my little ponie 2017 movie. And other kid shows. my daughters and sons was very mad about this.but on the other sign its good. Edit:Please fix this"
The latest update has made it so that the pause/play overlay cannot disappear by clicking. You have to wait for it to disappear or lock the screen. Please change it back
Overall apps Brilliant But For Example:U added konosuba But you deleted It and i Was waiting on the arrival of It but i couldn't find cause i whent on holiday and when i came back i couldn't find it and found out you got rid of the show so please Add back a Few shows but i just renembered it so imma rate it 3 Star
Netflix doesn't show movies or shows I know it has for me to watch. It's like they are outside my original genre options when I joined.
In redmi note 7 pro i experience a lag while opening the app. Sometimes the app takes too long to boot to the main screen. Which is frustrating sometimes.
App is full of content but.... Widewine L1 certificate gets dissappear and shifts to L3 suddenly. Then I need to perform clear data to bring back certification. This becomes really annoying when you are paying more for quality and then you strean at standard definition.
"Have great video quality, but i am unable to connect it with chromecast. Get this connectivity fixed. It was working fine with previous version."
"im on a chromebook,im only 8. and whenever i go on netflix it will never load or let me scroll down. its a great app to watch movies on and stuff,just its always glitchy and i cant watch anything. edit; i was just logged into the account my family and i have....now its saying i have to log back in.....can you please fix this///"
Never had any problems until recently. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling in order to get the app to connect to my chromecast.
I love the app however when I'm in the middle of a movie the screen freezes but the audio is normal idk if its a bug or my phone but if it is a bug please fix it as soon as possible.
I only use it with chromecast. It's very slow. It disconnects from the tv quite often. Sometimes it won't work.
Hi netflix I know this isn't an app issue but idk how else to contact but I really want u guys to consider continuing some of ur shows like Julie and the phantoms because I don't understand y a good and fan liked show has to get canceled after the first season when there's so much more for it and when shows like Riverdale can go on for forever so pls just consider continuing the shows and continuing julie and the phantoms because it really is a great show & it helped a lot of peoplewith problems
"I personally hate it. Movies are trashy, shallow, and boring, but the people in my household seem to like it. I'm really looking for a reason to cancel, and I'm sure Netflix will give one. They can pay for this garbage themselves if they want to watch these thirst traps and 40 year old movies that can be found on other streaming services."
I like all the option and love that theres practically no commercials but hate that half of the shows and movies have subtitles and it wont let me shut them off... I dont need or want them it's not fair that I have to pay and still have them on there...
My cellphone Samsung A32 5 G keeps giving me a 5.7 error message. Never had this before with any of my previous phones. Very frustrating when the series or the film that you are watching stops continuously.
5 Stars Until you connect it to an external monitor. No Picture due to DRM by the googling I did. 4 years is a long time not to fix the issue. cannot view my downloads on a TV with out internet access
"Love Netflix alot but why have you gotten rid of some of the best shows and movies? I used to watch all kinds of good stuff but now it's like there's nothing good I'd actually rather watch tv with commercials because there's nothing good on Netflix anymore! Everytime you search something it's never on here either, what's up with that?! Bring back House MD and I'll give more stars...Until then Hulu and Disney Plus has you beat BY FAR!"
Its ok now not the best pretty much all the diseny shows are off forcing me to get Disney + plus the dont really update there stuff a whole lot get more shows and dont switch stuff out im in the middle if the series and all the suden they dont have the show just add on 3 starts because i watch rhe hell out of netflix and i enjoy it recommend making an investment you your familey and friends will have a good time good for the holidays to
"Some suggestions: All user mustn't be able to see/switch other user activity only the admin user(whose email/phone number is used can see) and by that option, email/phone no should not be required on other user/device for login on same subscription (some kind of invitation code can be use for one time activation, this will reduce the sharing of account password among other users). Play back seeker needs some improvement."
"I enjoy having Netflix to watch on the go on my phone, but the app crashes 3 times or more every time I open it, and it is incredibly annoying."
"Was working perfectly on my Huawei P9+ until last night. Suddenly get the error message that netflix service cannot be reached. Works on my laptop & other droids.. Un& re installed, same problem"
"I've enjoyed using the app for years, but for some reason, there is now a click sound when switching between accounts. I can't disable that. Very annoying and unnecessary. Please make it go away."
After the last update theres no option to directly forward to the next episode when you are watching one. It was there previously but now its gone. Now i have to wait for the whole episode to be over including the credits ....which is annoying. Please look into it.
"It's a great app for entertainment, tho it's always saying that the video has a problem like always i tried everything like; restart my device, then uninstalled it but nothing happened. Can you please fix this problem? It'll be very much appreciated"
Newest update drains battery even when playing through Chromecast. Please fix. No reason that Netflix should drain my battery (labeled as active use when the phone screen isn't even on)
While watching a show it will cut off in a few minutes and I have to push the resume button but it will keep doing it. My WiFi is strong.
App doesn't open from time to time and gets buggy after a change of region. Can't find certain Netflix Original titles even though they are available globally.
"Latest update has made it so my screen wont rotate to fill the phone screen, nor can I pause it, fast forward it, nothing, except load the movie and watch it on a shrunken screen."
I don't have any complaints about quality but my netflix freezes sometime... It doesn't show anything just get freeze showing its logo. I am actually facing this issue rn!!
"Meh, the app it self has so many glitches, i.e., not loading box covers in trending despite having internet connection, new one to add was folding laundry static shocked me while ear bud in while watching and downloading a show now the first season and 4 Ep of the 2 is just static"
Please add an option to filter out dubbed and subtitled movies. I realize Netflix is available worldwide but I personally don't want to read while watching.
I'm giving 3 stars because i am unable to find some good seasons and movies (in pakistan) which my friends from another country are already watching it on netflix. Why is it? You have to fix this problem Netflix. Although i love Netflix. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"My. Problem is it always says no connection but i have wifi. This is really such a hassle were paying monthly but it doesnt give us our expectations. I hope you adjust your system, but I still love it because it gives me good content"
The other glitches are fixed for me. It's just that now tapping a show selects a random other show. I have a feeling the shows on screen are being sorted by a different method to the ones actually selected.
"I love this app but it price is slightly high and it gives contents according to your country, so if i want to watch a movie like' after' I cannot because it's in Netflix UK and Ireland and not in Netflix india."
"I absolutely love Netflix! Being able to watch my favorite movies and shows anytime is great! Now I used to have Netflix rated 5 stars, until you started canceling great shows. Such as Luke Cage, Daredevil, Jessica Jones and now THE PUNISHER!! Please stop the madness!!!"
I am facing this issue since last 3 days... The gets stuck on a black screen with Netflix written on it. The app doesn't even open. It's annoyingüò°
I found out that as I'm doing scroll in the coming soon part and the app just got freeze and still doing each time that I'm doing scroll and it's not because of the phone cause it's a Huawei p30 pro and Netflix's support should take a look to optimize the app for this phone
Too many glinches some episode can't be played need to skip an episode ... it's disappointing as knowingly it's known as the best place to stream for movies and other entertainment.
"Today when i wanted to watch a film which I had already downloaded before it could not be played error was 2.119 i called help centre they told me it wil take time how much time not decided as it is a technical problem, my question is that if it takes 4 days, who wil be responsible ull wil stop my viewing on the day my subscription ends, but the 4 days which i was not able to watch the programs who wil compensates"
"I start to use Netflix couple of days ago and i didn't have any problems with it, i could download my series at the background while watching som episode i have already download. suddenly now it won't download while watching i either have to download first then watch later. please fix this."
"Whenever I watch on my tablet, the image frequently freezes for up to a minute at a time. Slightly annoying when I'm just trying to relax and watch a series"
"Netflix needs to stop getting rid of amazing ash movies literally the only good movies they always remove LIKE beach what? yall getting rid of ""we're the millers"" and for what yall broke anyway cause your movies suck if yall get rid of the good place or any of my favs I will end my subscription cause yall need to up your Game fr like nobody gives a flip about ""is it cake"" or tall girl 2 yall cancel my fav shows and everything for what!? So yall can make a tall girl 2 like no you old flip"
The app is awesome and there are cool things to watch. But I don't like that in the other countries there are many more and good things to watch than where I live. I pay so much money and I can't even whatch what I want.
"Not working on android 5, so i cannot use it on (not excesively) old phones. On later android versions: Very few crases. Great with downloaded shows."
"With my 220mbps (about 15MB/s) connection the videos are of pixelated quality, like 240p on YouTube. Can't select video qualit, anywhere. That's quite inconvenient and renders Netflix useless for me."
I want more horror in english. Too many movies are subtitles and frankly I am ready to cancel Netflix because all I watch is horror and all they offer is subtitled horror. It sucks so let's get some english horror please.
"version 7.3.0 build 24 appears unstable. random crashes on S8+. frequently throws a file error 101.1.8. seems like a recent update introduced serious bugs. uninstalled, cleared cache, etc."
I just give 3 star because why'd you put limit on the download even though I have much more space from my storage hayssst. In wich we have this signal internet not really working on online movies so I just downloaded it while im in a strong internet cafe wifi. so pls dont put limit download so that au can watch my favorite movies and dramas! Arassoo! üòä
"How do you expect me to read subtitles on white on white backdrop the app doesn't have settings so I go onto browser but the browser said it was the black backdrop,when I attempt to watch it on browser it keeps telling me to download the app."
Alot of the movies started turning my screen dark and I couldn't fix it best advice was to uninstall and reinstall. When it works its great.
I have a android and I am unable to watch anything. I have restarted the phone and reinstalled the app multiple times. but nothing works. however this does work on my iphone.
"Auto play on Android behavior changed, it now stops & prompts you after 4 hours used to keep playing 8√∑ hours before the recent app update. Not good if you use this for white noise."
Great variety of shows. Terrible rewind/ff function. Should be able to skip forward and back by 10 second increments! Please fix Netflix?
"The app, it's good , but why you guys don't give us a option to choose quality of the video that is playing. That's just absurd. I'm paying for every content I watch and I can't control the quality of it."
It's good in American content but when it comes to Indian content Netflix lacks in various aspects no proper movies not too many latest movies... I don't find interesting these days. Most loved series by me was Money Heist and Elite so bring up something like this
"You need to tap the screen which is blank and when the brightness bar appears on the left, just scroll tilt up and down and the video will start working. Enjoy...."
I'm giving 3 stars cause they keep raising the price. It went up to $16.77 if it keeps going up I'm gonna get out of Netflix. I'm not gonna pay anymore on it. I hardly watch Netflix since I work too much.
"I am trying to open thw netflix from the last 3 days, but it is not responding at all. I uninstall it and again install it but no change. I hope the problem will fix soon"
Not easy to find drama or movie. Subtitle are not clear even after changing settings many times. Viu more user friendly compared to netflix.
"More often than not, the app is stuck buffering. Even with strong signal. It's difficult to watch anything. And too expensive to sit here waiting for anything to load."
"The subtitles can't be seen speciallu when watching light colored videos, can you add like a change color setting or go back to last update where the subtitles where fine.."
"i had intially given this app a 5 star but i havs downgraded it to a 3. You deactivated my account and refunded the money, and now i have to restart my membership again. and every time i put in my credit card details it won't work. I dont even understand why you deactivated an active account."
The shows are good but I think there can be a wider selection of shows. Overall the app is sometimes laggy and dosent work so good.
"it crashed while i was watching, it just stopped so i refreshed if multiple times then i went here updated it, but it was the same didn't even reached the home screen so installed and uninstalled it.seriouslyy"
"Over the last 3 weeks, I have to uninstall Netflix app and reinstall on my Huawei tablet which is very unsatisfactory as I cannot access anything when I log onto Netflix."
"I hate the fact that there are so many shows i can't even watch in Ukraine...like please make it possible for us to watch almost 50% of those shows... Quarantine is killing me already and there are so lesser shows on Netflix compared to France, or some better countries .. pls try to help us"
"It was working pretty great and after i got the most recent update, every time i open Netflix it kicks me out Edit:aug 2021, it was the opposite this time, I hadn't updated so it kept kicking me out"
worked well but had to uninstall because it was the number 1 drain on my battery even when i hadn't used it in weeks. apparently if you watch Netflix in other devices it communicates with yr phone hence the drain
Please try to work more on subtitles cause when the back ground is bright color and the captions are also in white.. It's hard to make out the words or sentence.
"It still works fine but selection hasn't been the same ever since every other company started up their own movie apps and they keep raising their prices, idk its getting harder to justify keeping Netflix subscriptions sometimes."
"I would say netflix they make ""good"" in marketing strategy. Seeing through having premium account with 5 profile to be activated at anytime we want, but only 4 movies can be viewed on the same day and time. i would be giving it with 5 star if they could give up all 5 profile to work on the same time and that would premium is all about."
What happened to the video off feature? that was very lovely to have and very useful as some people like myself like listening to films instead of just watching them...
It's ok until you wanna download episodes to watch on the go and it tells you you have reached the yearly limit when you haven't watched it yet. Or it tells you you can only download once more before Dec 1 1969........ And you haven't watched it yet. And terrible customer service they like your money not you remember that.
"I can no longer watch any shows? Its been paid for though all that pops up is ""there is a problem playing this video please try again"" ive tried many many times my dudes. All the shows and movies say it."
I would like Netflix to add more options than before and other stuff that has been removed from the kids menu but other than that I think Netflix is a quite good app.
Sometimes the screen just crashes and the picture becomes unviewable. Kind of like those old TV's do when the cable connection went off.
The App is fine for video playback but I kept getting notifications after I turned off notifications. Kinda annoying to get 3 notifications at 1:00 AM...
Don't get me wrong I absolutely love this app & Netflix in general but I have to say that there needs to a feedback option so people can suggest things that they may like or not (like me) & also you all need to be better with customer service if you guys can do that then I'll give you a better review!! üôèüôè
I give it three stars its a cool app to watch all my shows and movies but it keeps force closing and keeps subtitles on even though I don't turn them on.
Hey Netflix. I tried logging in with a valid shared ID from my cousin. Everytime I try to login it shows incorrect email or password. Kindly help me out in this regard.
"Please fix the brightness issue. Even in the lowest setting of the in app, it's just way too bright. Can't watch things with all lights off. Thanks."
Have big problems while trying to watch rhings eg the screen goes black and there is only audio. I'm always having to clear the data.
"This app is only good for bright (cartoony) shows. Most all movies are too dark to see on mobile devices, unless your watching in a completely dark room."
"I find the app ok, but THE CC size is ridiculously small. Why are they so small? How about making the size adjustable or give us the option to choose a size of subtitle that we can actually read. Have a look at how PRIME manages size. Please."
"i'm sorry but netflix isn't as good as it used to be anymore. trying to just watch...whatever exists i guess, but i have to restart the app because of the frame rate dropping every 15 seconds for me üòê"
Great app to download but there's a problem everytime I got to pay when it stops developing its system so much great movies but not as I wanted I would provide a discount for me because it stops regenerating the power sorry but still good
It's a suggestion to Netflix if you want your viewership going high in India pls translate more in Hindi. Such amazing movies/shows but no hindi audio or subtitles makes it difficult to enjoy. I am watching Lincoln lawyer and believe me if it was not in Hindi i wouldn't have watched it. Pls understand what viewers need
"UI is pretty bad, can't even remember which episode and where I was. You want a fantastic UI, do what Prime Video does."
I love all of the movies but what I really want is that all the seasons to anime is uploaded on to Netflix cause I don't have Disney so I can't watch all of the anime series at once like The Promised Neverland I can only watch 2 seasons but i really want to watch all of them so if your reading this please try your best to make it so all of the seasons to anime and other thing have all of their seasons I'm sure you will get an much better rating from people all over the world.
App keeps freezing and crashing. A bit of a kill joy when you have to restart a 20 minute episode 3 times just to watch it.
"Whenever I close this app, my status bar gets locked and I can't swipe it down. Only after restarting the phone, status bar works properly again. Fix this bug, please. Xiaomi Redmi Note 7"
Very small choice of movies for Thailand. You would want to get around it using a vpn of some sort. I think less than a few hundred movies including those of netflix.
Every time I start a show or a movie the damn sight kicks Me out to the start screen menu the I have to go back in. I can never watch a show without interruptions. Because it constantly kick me out.
"Good content, but surprisingly they decided no longer to accept my credit card after 5 years without reason, took a cursory look at the problem and told me there's nothing to do but close out my account. Customer service unfortunately poor"
I can't play certain movies... Bb it gives me some bs not not being in the right country. Uuuummm I live n Texas... And i should've been able to watch it. One of the movies is pain and gain with mark wahlberg.... I used to love Netflix but this messed it up for me.
"It was great until the last updated, when you finish an episode or whatever and hit the back button it plays the video all over again."
"It would be nice if they would stop discontinuing series that I watch. Like shadowhunters, the society, october faction, cursed, irregulars, and a lot more. Its kinda sad because most of them finish on a plot twist I mean at least wrap up the storyline."
I had the app on my phone I updated it and now I cant get back in. It's not loading anything just stays on the Netflix screen. I have uninstalled and reinstalled many times
"I think Netflix should be a free app. I personally don't understand why someone would pay to watch movies on their phone. And now days Netflix doesn't have anything new, only old nickelodeon shows."
Love the app but for some reason you removed the season selection button which is very annoying if you want to rewatch a specific episode or season.. please put that button back otherwise would be 5 stars
"Its pretty good. But for about 2 weeks now I cant even watch anything. When I press on a movie it will freeze but the it will keep playing, it's so annoying."
Why isn't there a two factor authentication option for logging in using a password and an OTP? Almost every other streaming application offers it as a standard feature.
Why Netflix showing 5.10 error ? when i play any movie . I restarted my phone deleted Netflix renewal install login sign out everything i do but its not working. Apps permission allowed. Help me any body!!!! üò•
"It doesn't work sometimes. Constantly gives a 5.x error, could not tell you why. Watched a show the night before, but today a 5.x error.... When it does work, it's great"
I cannot pause anything from my locked screen on android device while casting. All other streaming services allow you to pause without putting code in.
The app gives two options for accounts but only gives kids and unrestricted. It also allows you to block certain profiles Meaning teenagers with parents who don't let them watch anything over M but don't want to only let them watch kids shows have to enter a pin every time their teenager wants to watch something actually interesting. I think Netflix needs a teenager profile so that teenagers can watch shows that are appropriate for their age.
Good app but the constant price increases are starting to be a real turn off. May have to start shopping around for other streaming services.
I signed up on my TV and I was in the middle of watching a show and I just turned off I cut my TV on it said I have to sign back in so I did I put the same email address and password and they said it was Wong the owner really needs to check this oh and they keep deleting movies and they only let them on for 1 to 2 days.
It's great but I think the brightest slider is completely unnecessary. It always changes and it's very frustrating. But other than that it's great
"You removed the seasons/and movies from there, which is annoying as i heard they were really good for example supernatural cant watch that in the UK as it was removed!"
"Very expensive for what it offers. Always the same boring, old (and many terrible) movies, bad quality and sometimes terrible translations."
I love Netflix it has so many great things to watch but the reason why I have rated it a three is because you have decided to take the originals off it is my favourite show out of all the shows on Netflix i have watched it twice please add it back on because like other people i dont know how to watch it another way and people will want to see it so please add it back on
"Having troubles connecting to in built Chromecast in Mi Smart TV. Other applications like Amazon Prime and Youtube are casting perfectly fine. However, facing troubles with Netflix only"
The application is a disaster and the worst part is live support that they don't help you at all they just text you that there is a problem and they can't solve it. It's like the app is filtered in a country that I went for a trip and I'm forced to use VPN nor I can't use the app and I asked them what should I do and the answer was so insulting to me that they said you should try without VPN what is wrong with you people I can't use your limited app in the country and your solution is this?

"I love this app but customer service is a bit... odd. My most recent experience includes someone who says ""thank you for that information"" after everything I say. EVERYTHING. It was creepy but when I told him that what he was doing was unnecessary he said ""ohh... thank you for that information."" And hung up. I wish I could remember his name so I could thank him for making me laugh. 5 star app / 2 star customer service."
"The only thing I don't like about Netflix is the content that is designed for teen audiences... overly sexualized and themes like lgbtq, promiscuity and other themes I am not comfortable with. Parental controls available should give more specific options."
I think it is realy good but it just says that i cant reach the netflix service i have tried everything i payed the month and 8 checked my wifi and network it saided that it was all good but it still wouldn't work.
"In the last 6 months or so every time I use this app it glitches, it slows down and I have to exit and get back in. It's happening way to often and is annoying."
I keep getting an error 1023 .. could not reach Netflix service. Sometimes it fixes on its own.. sometimes takes a longer time.
I am getting error code -1023 every single time. Rebooting my Samsung Galaxy Note 9 several times didn't help. Date and time is OK. What possibly could get wrong? Update: it's improving...
"I've noticed some shows have started buffering n they seem to have the same movies on forever not mixing up the options n when searching for a movie it will show you the title of franchise your looking for yet it doesn't actually have the movie to view ,what's the point?"
"Between google home and Netflix, my 4 year old will probably have nightmares for months to follow. Ask google to play a kids show. The show ends and I get an add for a movie or show called ""His House"" where a skeleton is holding someone's ears. Great stuff for a 4 year old to see. Compatibility with Google home suck's."
"I'm seeing that Netflix on my device supports the new Black Mirror movie however I'm not seeing any option to play it. I get to the landing page and the description says ""be right back"" but there's no cast description or play button. Are we waiting for an update?"
"Ok, there is a series I really like on Netflix called miraculous ladybug and Netflix only has season 1 and there is a season 2 but it is only in Netflix of USA. My point is I don't want to go to USA just to get the series there"
"Ok, so, I love this app. I use it all the time, but one problem; Theres not enough seasons. E.g; ICarly, Victorious, Yugioh Arc V. I'd rather touch dont add them at all rather than only have a few seasons. Other than that, I love it"
Video got muted while watching downloaded video using earphones. I've checked my earphones and they are. Didn't expected these types of glitch on Netflix. please fix this ASAP
It's a great app for watching certain films but I'm currently having an issue with it on my phone where it seems to crash and not even load would be nice if this could be fixed please it works on my xbox but not on my phone
"It's okay. Sometimes crashes? Not sure why. Sometimes the subtitles come on and I haven't clicked subtitles? But meh, some really great films on hereüëç"
It was all going good for a year. But now whenever I try to open Netflix.it shows 1023 error and I don't know how to fix it.No helpline.nothing working. Please help
It's not the same as it used to be. I'd give it five stars if I could find my old movies and tv series I watched. I don't know what happened but I just can't seem to find them. I search for them in the search bar but they aren't there. Just random other movies and tv series that I am totally not interested in. It truly is annoying
It keeps on having error 50.1 something..tried to force stop the app and restart my device...after some time...the screen will go black but the audio is still there.
"When I want to watch a movie or episode, it sometimes restarts my phone for no apparent reason. I thought it was because I download and watch it. But it also restarts my phone. It even restarts my phone while I'm streaming."
Netfix is one of my favourite streaming channels. But lately it seems to be having trouble downloading & freezing up quite often.
So thanks a lot for providing best content at Rs 199.I referred to my frnds and everyone is enjoying Netflix. We all have a concern.Why not Hd at Rs 199. Its single screen.. That's okay. It would be best if Hd content is provided at Rs 199. This is the best plan till now but anyone could hardly enjoy its beautiful content at SD quality.
"Unable to play HD content on OnePlus 7 Pro on Android 12. The Netflix app reports Widevine level 1, however checking with DRM Info the device is on Widevine level 3. Customer support is not helpful with this and brushes responsibility off to the device manufacturer, however - incredibly - the blame is not on OnePlus in this case."
"Since updating the app, it keeps cutting out and insisting on subtitles every time I log back in again. Highly frustrating."
love Netflix but app seems to have issues every once in a while. always having to uninstall and reinstall.. it's getting tiresome.
Sonetimes netflix doesn't sign me in. Talks about network ish even when I'm on the fastest signal And then the call or ask for help button never works. Y'all gotta do better in that area please!
"I'm having a bit of a difficulty. When I want to watch a show or movie, it shows me a black screen. If it does work and show me pictures, the picture doesn't change, but the audio keeps going."
My bank account got hacked and I'm in Portugal at present. I'm back in UK soon and want to get it reinstalled but post takes a long time here and I have to get new credit cards. I've been here 6 months and have been hacked twice so you will notice I've hardly used the app. Apologies
It's really cool but I don't like how sometimes you take away people favorite movie or sieries and replace them with lame weird one that no one will like BTW I have a problem like every 13 hours it makes me delete Netflix and download it again to watch
"The app is good, it's just that you cannot set your default video resolution. Pretty necessary for me as I only have limited monthly data volume."
I can't access netflix in Smart TV. Its been 2 days now. I can watch using my mobile phone but with Smart TV. Its usually says Reconnecting Now then It wont connect. Please have it fix netflix.
Honestly I've had Netflix for a long time and over that period of time its run out of alot of good shows and replaced them with pretty mediocre shows I just wish Netflix has more verity like it use too.
"I give it 3 stars because netflix keeps taking off movies and series. For example, i wanted to watch pokemon xyz, but when i searched it up, it wasn't there!! Then i looking for other pokemon series, but none of them were there!!!"
The new mini player at the bottom is extremely annoying and should have an option to get rid of. And you cancel all the good shows.
Love the selection too bad it's slowly fading away in favor of cheap poorly performed shows which is Netflix desperate grab for new content as more streaming platforms become available.
"I enjoy Netflix but there are things I would like you guys to pay attention to, I believe Netflix must add some mainstream *anime shows* like *Naruto Shippuden and Boruto and their movies*, this will give Netflix a totally new feel as we will be able to stream anime legally and conveniently. I hope you see this."
"The reason of 3 star because lot of Movies & Seasons are missing. Example: all the movies Fifty Shades of Gray are missing, Nuruto season are already out & people already watched Boruto but in Netflix all the Naruto seasons are missing. People are paying hefty for Netflix hence Netflix needs to work on it."
Amazing content but there is one major glitch once u forward the movie couple of tines it the visuals get stuck and audio keeps playing until u restart the app a couple of times
I enjoy netflix both on Samsung smart tv and galaxy note 10 phone. But recently always get error -1023 could not reach netflix on phone while on same network as my tv.
"Kindly please do something with the video quality setting, we are paying for a higher package and getting SD quality. Looks like Prime is doing better then Netflix."
Can you have a word with your app developers for screwing up the screen rotation and screen response? The two fundamental features that made this app usable.... No bonus this month perhaps? Pretty annoying since we're all paying for it. Someone in the team is a donkey.
"Good, although I wish there was more choice of films and television shows. But overall, very smooth and beer had any problems. Keep it up!"
"I really like Neflix don't get me wrong I watch alot of shows, but I want Netflix to add this show called So Awkward because you can only watching on BBC Iplayer and I want it on Netflix so I don't always have to get off apps just to watch another show that's not on Netflix. Please add So Awkward the show on Netflix"
"This doesn't have any good shows like, CSI Miami, House, or The Good Doctor, this needs more shows. Also, a movie that a really want to watch, Night At The Museum: Battle Of The Smithsonian, isn't on there. So this also needs more movies."
Having issues watching on my tv the app keeps closing or in the middle of some movies the audio just stops Netflix please fix NOTE tv is new internet is fine and everything is updated not sure what's going on it's a Roku tv if it helps y'all fix it
"It's great tho but Lately, i'm getting an error while i'm on a middle of watching, you really need to check it to know why! It keeps giving me info to close it. I'm paying premium monthly and am getting this experience. Thanks."
It's really good but I'm not giving it 5 stars because it doesn't let me watch series and movies in Spanish from Spain. It only let's me watch stuff in English or Spanish for Latin American. If you can fix this I would give you 5 stars
This stop working after the update. all of my videos no longer even play they just freeze. I cant get into one second at this point and that's no joke only 1 second.
"Netflix is an amazing app/website to watch tv shows on! But i have problem with using the website,the problem is that only data is working but wifi is not working why can u resolve my issue?"
It is good but it doesn't give all the anime which it gives to the other countrie and the anime which it gives are only half of the whole series. Netflix I am giving the whole money you guys are asking for the subscription so I have the right to ask you why are not giving us Indians mor anime.
you guys need to put Hawaii five 0 back on Netflix so that way everyone who was watching it ( including me) can watch it through the rest of the show. so if you have the right of mind and a kind heart to put it back on that will be greatly appreciated.
"I find its o R original content lagging behind prime some but still Netflix. Better format less range. I mean how many interracial love stories do I have to watch to get one episode of sci fi and no teenage werewolf love stories dont count. And neither do Mars shows nobody cares about going to a big dessert except the people who's budgets depend on it. More rated r uh less blahs, please Christworth Bigimpton."
"Everyone can see other's movie list when share 1 account! Example: premium package with 4 sub-account, 4 persons pay 1/4 price each and can see what other seen! Netflix not care privacy! Must get sub-account include sub-username and sub-password! And 1 master-account! Please!"
"So far, it performs really well. Except for translation of captions. I speak both Korean and English but some captions are way to far from the dialogue. It would make some people confused. Like Baekdusan and Geumgangsan, you translate it as a dessert. What??? When would mountains be a dessert???"
"Hello! Me and my family enjoy this app very much, but I left a 3- star review because most of the classic kids cartoons were deleted from the app (exaples): Spirit stallion of the cimmaron, wild krats, How to train your dragon 1, 3 etc. If you do add these movies back I will give the app 5 stars with no doubt."
"it was good, but recently it's been telling me that i don't have internet connection even tho i have. the main page won't load, if i want to watch something i have to type and search for it and the other thing i don't like is that i can't turn off auto play when i'm watching series"
"Can't we just get some normal trailers or previews on everything and not just Netflix stuff. Also, who cares about 97% match or whatever? Match to what?!? Just give us normal ratings like other normal TV and Movies have!!! Netflix used to have normal previews and ratings, what happened?!?"
"I have a suggestion, make it such that no one can delete a netflix account without clicking confirm to a link sent to the email. Same way the password change works. Thank you."
Netflix South Africa is so behind there's new seasons that are already out but it's not showing. for example orange is the new black already has a new season but Netflix South Africa only has season until season 5!!!! don't get me started on iZombie. please fix this its frustrating!!!!!
"Please bring back the ability to view the description of the movie on mobile. This setup of just showing keywords is awful. I want a synopsis, not ""dark"" ""critically acclaimed"" or whatever six words are chosen to describe the movie."
When will we get a 30 sec forward button for all those rude scenes that come out of nowhere? It's especially concerning when there are parents and kids in the room! An entire film seems alright and then there's that one scene that ruins it. Seriously can't watch anything with family anymore.
The app is very slow and tends to stop working on my smartphone. I have a brand new Galaxy S9+ so I know it's not my phone or internet. Just wished it worked better. Will continue to use until something better comes along.
Not perfect with stuff coming and going but to be fair guess that's what happens when you have so much on your channel which really is kind of bullcrap really it shouldn't cost so much money when you have stuff on your Channel if anything it should be the exact opposite.
"it's a really great app, only thing is I can't watch avatar the last airbender. no big deal, I can watch literally everything else on the app, I was just really stoked about avatar. I've tried everything but it still says it can't connect. any advice?"
There's a lot of show variety which is good but it takes too long to find a show you're in the mood to watch at any given time. I suggest that you include some kind of search by tags method with which you can search for shows that align with multiple tags.
"So until today I didn't have a complaint for the app but they're rolling out interactive content and Android seems to be the only platform it doesn't work with. Game consoles, computers, TVs, and IOS devices, but not Android."
"Can someone answer me about the payment update? It say's on my app that I need to update my payment info, but everytime I try to update it, a message will always say ' Sorry we cannot update your payment info ' . . . . or something like that. There is no typo error, and my card have money and I'm been using it for Netflix since April."
The only issue I have with Netflix is the volume. I have to turn my TV up all the way and still frequently have trouble hearing dialog.
"It is a pretty good app but then when i searched ""The promised neverland"" it's not there, Do you guys have it? Because alot of people are saying that its on netflix but on mines is isn't. I don't know whats going on or you guys don't have it? Just please fix the bug."
"It's bad to not having all languages option like kannada etc., it's difficult to search or play the movies ,series in other languages we need the option in the same video and also you need give proper adult movies,series"
"I have an issue with the idea of movies and series that constantly get out of netflix, i know the idea of rights and stuff, but at least send notifications to the user that some stuff are gonna get out of netflix, like la casa de papel"
You guys should give details in description abouts which language the show is available in. It would be easier to see that whether the show is available in Hindi/ English or not. Most of us perefers to watch show in Hindi language but later on when we find that the show is not in Hindi language then we have to shutt it off and find another show which is in Hindi language. It's hectic because it was not described in description. Also give the sorting of top 10 list just don't show the random show
I love this app a lot it lets me watch some of my favorite shows and get into new shows I would say it's one of the best watching apps there is but I think the new update kind of ruined it because now you have to scroll down just to see one and the only thing screwing sideways is you're watching list I hope they put it back to the way it was and if they do then I totally recommend it
"The app is normally great, but doesn't seem as stable lately. A lot of the time it just seems to freeze on the logo on the opening screen."
"Great App but the new films and programs updated are very infrequent for a streaming service. For example, Police Academy 1 where is the other Police Academy's? Another example, John Wick 3,What happened to 1 & 2?. There are loads more to mention, considering cancelling subscription as Netflix is living in the past."
Easy to use app but lot of films whithout subtitle
I've had Netflix for two and a half years and all that watch is same old stuff over and over it says new and they're not new cuz I've already seen every one of them on Netflix. I don't think it's worth $12.99 a month when you're watching the same stuff every single month
"As everyone knows this app is good but not always have the movie you want. That isn't the reason that I am giving it 3 stars. Its because the took out one classical show and a movie: The Conjuring and FRIENDS.Now its has other old nonsense of movies.All I have to ask is put it back please,at least one of them so we could feel more comfortable within this time period."
"Today I just couldn't update my payment info after finishing my membership..even I tried from another debit card too thinking of it was a card issue..but still after sending the otp and continuing it is coming to the payment page with a massage ""there appear to be a problem with the payment method u r trying to use"".This is the first tym this is happning so i couldnt restart my membership..give me any suggetion what to do"
Works like Netflix with one exception. The drop down season selection does not work. I click it and it just gives me the episode 1 information.
"Overall a good experience but missing important to me features mostly about organizing. A neat personal library would be great. I think some ticks and some X-es are not that hard to code, others have them."
I have an android and whenever I try to watch something the video is pitch black but the audio still keeps going. Or there are other times when it suddenly freezes but the audio still keeps going. So basically I cant watch anything
Its pretty good. But netflix keeps removing the good shows and movies and keeping the stupid ones. I also think you guys should add whether or not the show is completed or if it will have new season because I hate starting a show for it to have another season the next year.
"What's so hard about writing a synopsis? Most new movies and shows opt for a ""this series features [insert random actor] from [insert random movie here] and other random actors but doesn't actually tell you what the movie or show is about on the info section, what's up with that? Besides that Netflix is great"
"ok so hi the experience with this app was really wonderful until the new update come up. It's crashing the whole system. I can't watch via any mobile device, it's a real downer, can you fix it asap? thank you!!"
"My device is HDR supported but Neflix playback specifications say "" HDR Capabilities: None"""
"I love this app. But recently I'm experiencing a problem, every time i open the app it says error of (- 1023) i have to restart my phone each time i open the app or uninstall and re-install. Please can you help me know the reason."
"Normally love the app! However, was trying to watch from my phone and the player kept minimizing on its own. I went to check for updates and downloaded the newest one and am still having the same problem."
I really do like netflix but there is One Problem... The problem is that there removing good Movies and shows like goosebumps 1 and 2. But it really makes me mad that they removed bolt. That was one of my favorites and I wanted to watch it again today. And they removed phineas and ferb. That also made me mad. But I would recommend getting the- Oh ya and also spongebob. Anyways I was saying I would reccomend getting them back there are a lot more of shows that they removed and made me mad.ENJOY
Get 2x speed feature on tap hold on screen while playing videos
"Sometimes when I play an episode the video doesn't load, the only thing I see is pitch black. Also, it would be convenient to have a resolution changer."
"The app is good and all but every time I update it, my downloads stop working. So I either have to redownload them or watch them online. I tried everything but this ""bug"" persists. Its very annoying and a huge turn off."
Works fine it's great but lately I've been having issues for some reason. Now I have to change my password every day in order to check my account and login into my account. This problem needs to be fix asap I don't like changing my password every single day just to watch something as well.
Raising price again? 2 less stars. Too much!! I'm old w fixed income. Don't want or need higher price. I don't do all the suggestions in tips and tricks. Plain Jane watch TV. No ads is the biggie plus.!
"Newest update has messed with things...I can not view ""my list"" at all. It just continues to say ""can't connect to Netflix"" even though everything else works fine."
"The app itself is good but the fact that you're not getting the movies you've been waiting for depending on the country you live in is not so cool because I've been waiting for so long for Alchemy of Souls Season 2 but it won't show in my app even though it should've been released on December 10th and it's already released for US citizens ,if it could be fixed because i really want to watch a lot of movies that are sadly not available in my country"
This is just a big nope for me.All the new movies ain't even out on Netflix.This just frustrates me.Anyway apart from that it is decent.Although on my home screen.There is literally no movies!!So I recommend use another app unless you are in USA!So if your in the UK I recommend you not to use this app for movies.
"New update is horrible. When you click on a movie to view the description it won't let you hit the back button. I either have to close out the app and start over, or hit the home button"
"Its been 20 minutes, a movie is still loading even if i have full internet connection"
"Its not a ""smart download"" if yout app tells ke about it everytime, and makes me dismiss a notification. Smart things happen in the background, and dont expect a pat on the back everytime."
"The android version works well, it's a shame that the same cannot be said regarding the PC version, a lot of important features are missing, like editing the continue watching row etc."
there is not much new stuff and all the good mini series stop at season so soon as I'm getting into the shows there at the end. a lot of movies I thought would be on the site are not. it's not worth 1499 a month
It's really nice but it takes lots of time to download movies
It would be great if the layout stopped changing. It's hard to find new releases and genres without initiating a search now.
"For some reason, when I'm watching a certain show, once season 3 ep 1 finishes, it skips to season 3 ep 4. I have to manually go back and press on episode two, which is then in the end credits and goes to episode 3, which then goes to episode 4... is anyone else having this problem?"
"As I am a volunteer in a foreign country, I find it quite annoying that I can't seem to change the language if the app? I don't care what ""how I met your mother"" is called in Finnish, or the Finnish notifications üòÖ Everytime I have to translate everything, which is really disencouraging."
The updated app has lots of bugs to take care of. The show's won't start from where I left it and if I try to fast forward it gets stuck. Pls fix it.
Quite disappointed i am. It doesn't have too many good series updated. Ex: 1.my hero academia 4 th season started and available for free on other sites but it doesn't have. 2. Seven deadly sins 3rd season is out and available for free on other sites. It doesn't have.
I love the app but some of the shows I'm not really interested into I've kinda stopped using it because my two favorite animes are not on there the first seasons are on there but not the rest first is Bleach there wasn't the rest of the show on it and second Naruto was on there but Naruto Shippuden wasn't and that made me kind of sad and mad. Which made me want to write a review ask him if Netflix could put Naruto Shippuden has a show on Netflix.
"I really enjoy watching netflix, when I register I was able to try the 30 days trial, but when I am about to pay for my account, since I enjoy and love it, it won't accept my payment and i don't know why, I tried and tried again but it won't alow me, I really don't know what to do, It should be 5 üåü i hope you can fix this, I am from the Philippines and I don'thave any other method but paying using my debit card, thank you"
Hi because everytime I open the application. All profiles are always showing and you need to select your the profile you want to use. I suggest to put a pincode or security code for every profile. Because even our kids can open the profile that they not belong to them if they want to and learn to open it.
"I can't find dramas or movie's in my account but i can find them in other accounts please fix it please!!! Pretty pls. I tried searching dramas or movie's google hoping that it'll work if im just gonna click the button ""watch on netflix"" but when i click it says error but when i tried it in other account it worked... Why is my account really mean to meee!!!!!?? Fix it pleaseeeee + i don't think the problem is my internet . PLS FIX DIS COZ I LOVE NETFLIX üëÄ"
"I have a big problem of watching seasons of Netflix shows and they end with a cliffhanger. You invest hours of your time and emotions on a show and left in a high dudgeon, with no resolution. Over and over again."
"Netflix needs to stop suggesting the same shows and movies over and over again. No matter what category we search, it suggests the same content. Please use a better algorithm."
"I dont have a problem with what's on Netflix, but I think the new update keeps messing with the app. It wont stop pausing or when I try to press play on it, it wont play."
Lot of material to watch but often feel there's no filter in quality.... u have to weed out low level material in order to find a gem of a movie or show... often feel like finding a needle in the haystack.... compared to that hot star has significantly improved the quality of material... so that u don't have to weed out useless shows n movies
"The app is great. But I have one major issue, why are there series where the first seasons are deleted and we can only watch the most recent couple seasons? I wanted to start watching a series that looked interesting to me but it starts from season 4. That's sad."
Why would you move the search bar to the top of the screen? It's super annoying especially with larger phones! My wish for the next update is to have the previous interface back! Bummer!
I'm so sick of not being able to disable the autoplay function. It's killed my phone battery to the point of my alarm for work not even going off because it couldn't charge fast enough while it played all night. Fix this please.
I find a lot of times netflix will not load. It tells me it's not aval. And why is my price 19 when your last message said it was going up to 17 which I've already been paying that amount. I guess its time for me to go shopping for another provider.
"not as good as it used to be. I so loved this app before but now the app has too many useless originals that it has made me upset and i end up watching the 70s show over and over again. no new movies like 3 years ago. It has changed and for me, not for the better. I'll try again next year."
I am unable to update my payment details on Netflix. Banks don't accept debit cards and you don't have an internet banking option. I'm stuck and very disappointed about the lack of options. Need help urgently please.
"1. No rating for video recommendation 2. Not efficient way to see the detail of video 3. New episode in some videos always come late 4. Confusing of ""my list"" and ""like"" function"
"Not playing my downloaded episodes smoothly, instead it moves for a second and pauses and then repeats. Also plays with no audio now. Started a few minutes ago."
"i seem to have lost the ability to pause, move through the run time of shows and cast like i used to within the app. very frustrating."
"You should put some more classic movies (especially during quarantine ) like the titanic, pretty women etc... And also complete movie series like the matrix beaucause the matrix 4 is not on netflix, Alvin and the chipmunks, bring it on andother movies. And also put big TV shows like the good doctor!?!and maybe act on the comments that people post??!!"
I can't watch any videos even downloaded one. I tried uninstalling/installing the app but it didn't work. There's no issues with net connection since I am able to download videos. Can you check on this?
"Netflix not to be mean, but does whoever in charge? there have any sense instead of getting new episodes of ladybug and cat noir, you remove good movies and put rubbish like shaka zulu with the bad picture quality even,. pls guys we should consider the kids and teens if new episodes of squid games the glory and ladybug and cat noir and Ect.. add new. Episodes of popular shows than netflix would become super popular trust me üôÉ"
it is a good app but for the price we pay it's limited it's choices i wish they were how it used to be where it had a lot more content as they've recently got rid a lot of good shows and movies and replaced them with crappier ones
After the recent update of the app I think there is a problem with the subtitles as it's showing a black background which is very annoying. I hope you will resolve this issue by the next update.
"Love Netflix but just got an update and the picture in picture is no longer working, which is a feature I used ALL THE TIME. Very disappointed."
I don't know if it's a bug or some setting issue. If I pause a video and my phone is in locked mode the video resumes by itself after 5 minutes.
"I was supporting this app from day one and now they are making hard for me. Some series are taken off. I was watching this series called the 100 and now it's no more in the app am mad super mad. I feel bad to write this because I love this app. I paid and I cant find the series I want and it's not the first series to be taken off even vampire diaries, peaky blinders and so on. 2020 /may/20th."
"As mention by some of 4/08, my shows also have been disappearing from my ""continue watching"" list as well as can't be searched for, but is fine on the PC. Please fix this."
"i still cannot cast from my phone to my smart tv. what's up with that? plus the movies aren't really the latest or updated. To most movie I've attempted to see, there's something similar instead of what i requested. why is this?"
"Can I ask a question, why does it say ""last to watch on netflix april 30"" is the anime ""bleach"" getting removed permanently or just the same in the anime ""in another world with my smartphone"" getting back after a few weeks or months and when i watch something the options is stuck unless i adjust the brightness."
Captioning format not good. I've tried changing the settings on the Netflix website but it's not taking effect on the app. White on white is just not working and rather annoying.
Works fine but ran into some weird behavior. When I charge my Pixel 6 Pro (via usb-c) the screen continuously flickers. Doesn't happen on any other full screen video playback apps.
"***Fair warning, my account was hacked for a week. I was told it was because some hack/spam emails are able to do so, but Idk. Becareful with your information for anything. Slightly scary that someone or thing could do that to Netflix. Be careful."
Please get the one piece anime updated arcs and dont jump straight to the latest episodes
Great app with a decent variety of content however I dont like how they changed the coming soon page it used to show you what shows was coming to netflix for the next month or so now it only shows you a few days in advice making it harder to know about new shows please put it back to how it used to be
Wish there were more options of newer movies then what's available or that we didn't have to upgrade every time someone else is using another device to watch what they want in another room but all in all it's nothing to be disappointed in. Works well enough to keep my kiddos entertained lol.
I am using Samsung Galaxy 8. And the app doesn't work sometimes. I don't know why this is happening. The solution I have found is to restart my mobile. But can't do to everytime it happens... Its really annoying.
"The Netflix app now has the ability to take over the brightness of the screen, which is terrible since you can't adjust the brightness bright enough to see more than half of the movies available."
Great suggestion in the theme or genre searched. But tile suggestions on home page are misleading leading you to believe the viewing selections are limited. Better ways to search would be helpful.
Still da best streaming app
"Bring back ""AWAY"". The #1 show ever and they decide to cancel it. Their excuse it cost 6 million an episode. How? You have built and purchased everything needed already. And with technology you probably don't need most of it. What a shame."
"I am not receiving updates from Netflix these days, usually there's a notification for every new episode of the drama that I have been watching, but now I am not receiving any. Kindly check!"
I used to love this app but it no longer gives a small synopsis or explanation of movies or TV shows. I have uninstalled then reinstalled the app no change. Please fix!!!
"I am using this app for more than an year and I love netflix, but since a few days it has been glitching. I don't know what is happening but it has been glitching a lot lately. Please solve the issue."
I don't expect Netflix to take this personally but I starting to hate how Netflix cancels all the shows that I'm a fan of and not only me but thousands of people too like take fate the Winx saga for example me and other people want to see season three but it's all a mess now that Netflix has canceled it and that's why I'm giving Netflix three stars
Netflix is charging a lot more than it's content is worth(not talking abt mobile plans)...subscription should be on the basis of the content the user wants to view and not for the entire platform.
"Im dissapointed, before, I can watch many movies like usual but lately I cannot watch it, it said "" cannot watch as your internet is low, use wifi instead "" but my internet was full and 4G for goodness sake!! I dont want to waste money for this... I hope you guys can fix it soon, please... sincerely from your loyal customer"
Really one of the best app but there should be more feature so that more people can use this app. i want to uae this app but i don't have more time. netflix should add feature of fast forward and sharing of download video. means download video should be seen in Galary. it will increase interest and demand of this app.
Would be 5 stars but the most annoying thing ever is the preview automatically casting whatever your previewing automatically totally annoying it just randomly plays things while I am just searching and I can't turn it off.
"I love this app, it's great to watch anime and miraculous ladybug. However, you're removing Ouran Highschool Hostclub and some other popular anime which is going to damage your popularity A LOT. Also, on mobile a picture freezes and the audio continues to play 24/7. It keeps me from watching shows. Fix it please."
"In the latest release, I no longer have picture in picture option anymore :-( I'm no longer able to play games etc and have my Netflix as a small window at the side anymore"
Sometimes when I'm watching it freezes you'd think it would have that circle but no it just freezes all I can do to fix it is exit and click on the resume watching button
I had been trying to update and watch movies but it always says service error :( i deleted some of the downloaded movies since i can't play it. A bit dissappointed
"Every thing is great, except a feature is required to increase playback speed, it's very necessary some shows can be really slow"
"Only just a slight step up from mediocre in terms of content on offer. A shame really, as the app has quite a good user interface."
"Suddenly, the ""skip intro"" in every series vanished. It irritates me that I can't skip the intros smoothly now. Please fix this immediately."
seems like chromecast compatibility has gone down hill. Frequently requires a couple of attempts to get it to connect.
"The lack of setting and the fact you have to go out of the app, sign out of all devices doesn't work, the subtitles won't go away."
I love this app ... but i dont know from somedays .. so many errors are coming when ever i start the netflix like 1001 501 and what not. I dont the reason i tried to clear data clear cache and restarting my phone but still it wont go. Is it bcz of the new update in samsung or any other reason .. whatever it may be just fix it plz.
this app is great but the reason I give it a three star is because you need to add more movies for example you download a show app and type up a movie and you type that same movie on Netflix but cant find it and the movie app that you find it on is totally free you need to fix that thank you
"overall its a good app but just recently went to download it on my chromebook, and every time i attempt to launch the app i get brought to a black screen and nothing else it just stays black, please fix this thank you"
"In general it's a good app, but there is one very anoying thing - every app update you can't see your downloaded content and you have to redownload it again."
A Decent Media App. Although I hate how 75% of Netflix Originals stop in season one or two. It's like going to your local library and finding all the books have half the pages ripped out.
"Been a lomg time user of netflix so i feel a 1 star is undeserving, most usage is reasonable although ""are you still waching"" is irratating. My main issue is the app just doesnt work at all on my sons tablet, quits at launch 100% of the time."
I still love Netflix except i just had an increase this past year from $7.99 to $10.87.. just got an email it's going to $12.99+tax!! not sure if it's worth it being i get hulu for free!! üòî
"Landscape mode for menu would be nice. Since my phone broke I can't sign in. App design ok, but broken phone folk need landscape and search engine could be better. Over all 3*"
"This app is great on phones and television. Streaming is easy and fast. I just don't like to be limit, and Netflix limites you."
"The offline/download option is terrible. There are always error messages, you need to try multiple times to get a movie you dowloaded to work."
There should have been other payment options .only payment option available is through debit and credit cardswhich also doesn't include rupay card support.there are a lot of people in India using rupay cards.also you should add a upi id payment support
"Although i do like the services that netflix has given me but there is a problem with the app i have android ""xiomi redmi note 10"" this phone does support HD content but sometimes when i open the app it doesn't support HD when i delete the app restart my phone and again install the app it does support HD i don't understand the why this keep happening to me So if you could please fix this problem it'll be really great for me"
It seems Netflix is having some payment glitch which is not supporting reoccurring payment now. Please look in to the issue on priority. Thanks!
"I have had trouble with New NF movies and series playing, some times it just stops and says we are having trouble playing this show try again later. Julie"
We downloaded few tv series and in just few days it was deleted and we need to download it again. Its a waste of data. Data are purchase via GB and we need to buy again because of Netflix faulty app.
"I am not sure what has happened recently, but the app doesn't work. I have to restart my phone to fix the issue. When I launch the app there is the Netflix logo and the app freezes"
It's a really nice app with reasonable subscription price but I'm having an issue with the fact that my phone is not being able to play in HD even tho it is Widevine L1 certified.
"I tried to watch a series on my phone but when I press play, all I get is a black screen as if my phone is off. I can hear the people talking but not the picture and when I minimise it then the picture appears. Please fix this issue"
"I wonder why Netflix doesn't make a difference between movies section and tv shows section in my list, it's random to open my list to look for something and find out that your favorite movies and series in the same section"
"Need more variety in movies. Its pretty boring seeing the same selections come up over and over. I dont wish to see a movie where i cant understand the language. Subtitles are not the answer, i chose english as my language and i do not want to hear anything else that i cant figure out or if i can by the time i do i have lost the story line."
"I would give it a much higher rating if shows wouldn't launch until you read what they where about, need to hit back key to get back to info page."
It happens with me everytime ... Whenever I recharge my netflix account .... It doesn't accept my previous debit card ... And have to find different debit card every single time whenever I want to recharge my netflix .. please slove this issue ... And I'll give 5 stars
I love the app and all but when I try to watch it the screen turns black. It's a problem. Although this might be a problem with my used phone I'm not sure. If this is a glitch please find a way to fix it. Thank you.
"I'd like to be able to specify the number of episodes the app auto continues to. In my case, zero. I'd also like to auto-skip show intros."
"I always experience lag. I tried uninstalling and installing it, tried rebooting my internet but it's no use. I've been experiencing this lag for 3 days now."
"Brightness at night is too bright, even with Netflix's manual brightness at the lowest setting. Other video apps don't have this issue."
This app is just fine. I just wish that Netflix had a better selection of movies like they used to have. The selection gets slimmer every year.
"Hello please fix this issue, Video is not starting from where It was stopped last time. Everytime I am playing it, it is starts playing from Starting only. Please fix this bug, ASAP. üò§"
I've been with them since the DVD days and I like it. My only gripes about it are some of the shows come out with weekly episodes and I've already seen a lot of their content. Edit they keep jumping the price up with out giving us more.
Error 2.119 is ruining the experience especially when you're on a capped data plan! Support couldn't help at all as well. Please look into it & fix this soon. Otherwise gre
I love Netflix always something to watch just hate how long it takes to get all the series up to date some will be on season 6 but Netflix only has up to season 3and then they take so long to update them please fix this!
"Everything is great but lately, I've been receiving something that says ""error"" when I try to open the app and saying that they can't reach my Netflix service."
"I like Netflix, but what they are doing with the prices and trying to control screens and locations. I HAAATE. I THINK ITS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS."
"Why is it that I always need to close and reopen the app because nothing is loaded in the netflix. Only when reopen, list of movies are loaded. Please fix."
it had good movies and shows but when it says that something is being added it doesn't come or movies just disappear for the app then comes back weeks later.
"It would get a higher rating from me if it would not remove movies and shows, also when it puts a show it puts the whole thing."
My phone is widevine l1 supported and the previous version was showing hd support but suddenly it stopped showing that. And now it shows l3 with maximum sd support!!
Netflix needs to come up with a warning system and a way to clear up my list. Not being able to add to my list and not being able to clear it is very annoying.
"App is good, needs more functionality improvements, but the selection sucks. How many dumpster fire ""originals"" can you pump out until you realize you need better content?"
"Love the app but it's really slow on adding New movies or Shows. I'm disappointed. Come on, There's alot of amazing Movies that are out and still haven't made it to Netflix. Hurry up and add ""Wreck it Ralph breaks the Internet"". Thank you."
"Regarding to the base, it's a great app, but it keeps freezing at some point and there's no way to get the movie going without having to uninstall and reinstall the app."
"Invaluable!!!! Upon downloading movies, when I play, what pops up on my screen, ""oops, something went wrong....."" So what? Fix it. I'm paying for things to go wrong? What's worse, the screen is üåó"
Some shows are unavailable and not at all relateble suggestions are frustrating other then that its fine but y does it removes movies and them put them in coming soon ..
It works well for the most part. I would like an ability to skip 10 seconds while using Chromecast.
"I updated my Netflix app and now all my shows and movies are delayed. At first i thought it was my phone, or service or maybe the show I'm watching, but no it's on everything"
"False advertising for what the description for app says, you are not allowed to stream more than 2 devices at a time. Other than that, nice for streaming"
"Plenty of movies have been removed, content discovery is weak and repetitive. In-house content is not as interesting as it used to be. Overpriced as well"
There were good movies but some great movies at tv season you can find online for free is not in netflix and it is really frustating and other tv season is late for example in The flash there is season 6 but it is still season 5 in netflix theyre not updating it
"Some latest movies and tv series are so slow to be available, up to months. Compared to US, they are really localized to where you are. So some good tv series are not available."
Mistakenly cancelled auto pay instead of cancelling membership and Netflix have set it such a way not to re-enable auto-pay from that particular UPI ID. Such a bad setup and making complicated
"I love netflix and I recommend to everyobe, but could the developer fix the bug of error 5.7 . I dont think anyone like to keeping pause amd ask you restart the app when you watching the movie"
"its an amazing app but there is one issue, my downloads suddenly stop then I have to pause it and starts it again but sometimes is works or i have to download it again."
"It was okay until the recent update, but then it always says ""Netflix is not working"". I don't know what happened and then my downloads can't be accessed. PLEASE fix"
Great variety of shows. However it seems to drain battery more than any other streaming service available. I can watch for an hour and have used half of my battery. Needs improving
"It was a good app, until it kept saying this title is unavailable chose another. This is happening for every thing I want to watch. When I went to the help page I did everything it said. Nothing worked."
"love the app and I have no problem with it but, the problem is I can't enter my Netflix gift card which is the only way I can pay for my account. Please fix this and I'll rate this a 5 star"
I gave this a three because I can barely watch any of my favorite shows because there aren't any of the other seasons like for example fairytale and I love the show but I can't watch the whole thing which is upsetting.
"Earlier this year, netflix used to be amazing, however the mobile site has gone down hill when my language preferences changed to Polish and English isn't even given as an option anymore."
The subtitles load automatically even when I close them.. Whenever I fast forward a video or start the video at some point the subtitles are automatically switched back on.
It's a good app. No doubt I downloaded many vedios and after watching one vedio I deleted it but all of my downloads got deleted. that was very frustrating cause I will have to download it again.
I love Netflix. But the UI is garbage. why is my list all the way at the bottom amd half the time i cant find even basic features
there's an issue where i got black video sound is running subtitles and the other. it's just the video turns black so often the video turns normal when i press back and click on it again but later the video got black again please fix this
Good for streaming but the video can go all grainy. I haven't any other issues. But most of everything good has been removed. And they added Cuties which knocks off another star.
"They raise the price every couple months, is too expensive right now, is a lot, the same price the Netflix, you pay Hulu, Disney, Pantaya have variety and for all ages. Netflix is expensive, is overrated."
"i love it , i hope there is an option to watch videos in prefered resolution instead of automatic. will give 5 star if that feature is available ."
"The best app for watching variety of movies but I think that on the free version they should provide a little more of the action English movies,,,, but really like the app"
It's a very nice app but it has glitches and not many movies or doesn't have all the seasons for tv shows like the flash I want to watch it so much but it doesn't have season 6.
It's just plain not working I tried to skip an opening then It wouldn't let me see the episode and it just has an error loading episodes everything even though I have full internet bars
I love Netflix like in the car you can watch it if your sleepy and want tp fall asleep like me I reall recomended this app for you the only thing wrong is the movies or shows you donwload don't stay downloaded it expires so I recomened this app for you though
Not many movies in general. I would love if we could control the video quality ourselves and not just run in auto. Would like more movies and tv shows please.
The app is a great app but for some reason now I am having so many issues with it its crazy could someone help me please.. It keeps saying netflix isnt available the moment.
"Terrible UI, what happened to sorting from A-Z and I don't like scrolling up-down left-right. Very annoying. Decide or Mae it a choice in settings."
"Not working as of late for some reason I can start episodes but then they lag and stop playing, but the voice is still there which has never done that to me before then the update happened"
crashes my phone on numerous occasions. only way I can get my phone to work again is by restarting or taking out sim. NO OTHER APPS DO THIS TO MY PHONE. they also removed background listening which I am really unhappy about.
"what happened to downloads?! I downloaded yesterday, and today they are gone as is the entire option for downloads. I discovered this while in flight, which is why I downloaded the shows to begin with. Very disappointed!"
Hard time reading the subtitles because its white. I suggest you put a black OUTLINE on the letters and not just a black background or highlight.
"Collection is great no doubt,only downside is we can't see the playback resolution.A lot of times it looks like playing at lower resolution while paying for high"
"Netflix is an interesting platform, particularly in the enabling of indie filmmakers, but i think the lack of ethics and morality, the clear push for hedonism, to be very concerning."
"Not a bad streaming service, selection could be better. Loses 2 stars due to lack of quality control and upping thier price."
"Please renew your partnership with Google Play so i can use it as a payment option. I don't have a credit card, nor a PayPal so Google Play was the only way to go and its been taken off"
"Decent app, but the varieties of movies disappoint me. Most of the movies are from America, and for foreign movies or films to exist in the app is extremely rare. No Ghibli, HP, and Endgame? Bummer."
There should also be an option to download the full series at once on the series download on Netflix. These improvements or updates are very important.
"All the star trek shows are gone and I do not see much here for those of us who like sci fi. Likewise, even at Easter or Christmas there are extremely very little of religious shows. Yes, we can watch the Easter bunny and Santa shows as an over abundance from October through January and then in July another heaping helping but nothing of Jesus. Can't you even put some of the older religious movies at Christmas and Easter? Even a 1960 or 70s movie? Not angel show but JESUS movies"
They always show you the same suggestions.There aren't much options in the regional languages.Just some recent films.And the options for 90s and early 2000s are less too.
Quality of Netflix is definitely decreasing. I am not watching Netflix as much as before. I'm losing interest in the content. I'm seriously considering canceling my account.
i rate it three stars cause its good but at the same time Netflix sucks.they remove shows for an other shows that are not even interesting. netflix doesnt even have all new movies and new cartoons that √ßame up like encanto and sing 2 and so many more.
So Netflix it is a bit stupid how I can be sat watching a program and you pop up asking if I'm still watching like every 15 mins yet if I actually fall asleep To a series I wake up and it's like gone through a whole season lol sort your stuff out Netflix
"This app in not for everyone, because you can't use this app without card like visa, MasterCard and American express.payment option is very less. There are many who have special card and there are many who don't have."
Loved it in the beginning but now all that seems to be new is from another country. Hate subtitles and dubbed films. All I ask for is movies where the actors actually speak English. Australian and English movies are great too but the other stuff is just awful.
"It was good but suddenly stopped being compatible with my phone. I've checked and play protect is fine, and everything is up to date."
"Downloads keep expiring, and can't be easily renewed. I hate having to keep uninstalling and reinstalling just to fix expired downloads."
"Hello, good day. I'd like to ask for the subtitles to be customizable or atleast be readable enough. That's the only feature that is bugging me about, thank you!"
"I don't like how the subtitles are sometimes lower cased and sometimes capitalized. When it is capitalized, I can't read it fast enough. This is a major accessibility issue for ESL users."
"i have been experiencing a lot of problems with the app recently, i can't see some episodes, the screen turns fully black and the episodes just stop loading and you can only see the subtitles."
"listen this app is great on my phone and everything else but it wont let me open it up on my chromebook . its up to date on updates too, so i dont understand what the problem is. ive tried turning my chromebook off and then going back online and nothing happened . if you know what ican do to fix it please let me know"
Yellowstone not showing up in mobile app. But I can access via my laptop
"Dont get me wrong, Netflix is a great app but I genuinely want to know WHY tf Netflix takes out amazing shows. For example: Liv and Maddie and NOW Vampire Diaries. This is why Netflix sucks. They always take out the good shows/movies and add in terrible ones."
"Good app for watching movies,series,anime and everything available to watch it on online or you may download it to watch later good facilities to change language.Every new coming season is updated at its date on breafing or take one or two days to upload"
"I didn't have any problem before. But now when I try to log in, I can't. I installed, downloaded and even I reset my phone many times, and nothing. But I only have this problem on my phone, on the TV and laptop everything is fine. Can anyone help with this. Many thanks."
Please Netflix... Provide more feature especially on Caption/Subtittle like putting a Background Shadow or Black Colour at the background of caption/subtittle to make us see the Caption/Subtittle clearly...thank You...hope it will have improvement soon...
The app no longer keeps valid track of what I've watched when I pause the film or show I'm watching. I have to search about and find my spot when I return.
"HELP!!! ever since the last update,Netflix won't play on my tablet...I tried uninstalling it,and then reinstalling, but it didn't work,and now I'm reduced to watching movies on my chappy little cell............"
"Nice app ,opens in my laptop and my huawei phone.But tried to watch on my Samsung note 8 but still it can't open.Made contact already to Samsung help and they said the issue is with my Netflix account.Am still confused what to do ,if you can help i will really appreciate Thanks"
Netflix app is running fine separately but i am not able to control my ps4 account by my mobile app. Earlier i was able to control it but now am not able to do so.
"Updated the app few days ago and now I couldn't open it, even with stable internet connection. Uninstalled then installed again, but could not reach Netflix service."
"It's a really good app, Could be a bit quicker with the new TV shows and the film's. But all in all pretty good prices should come down though."
"Greetings everyone. Came here to file a complaint about some, or so i say A LOT of series lacks or are incomplete with seasons. You release a lot of shows so adding all the seasons to a certain series won't hurt right? Thank you and have a nice day!"
I love the app it's just that sometimes the picture freezes while the audio continues. This goes on for a good 5-10 seconds during playback
Great view but just that it's too pricey. Some times you are unable to process the auto pay. But it's the best bet and the number 1 trend app.
I can't see movie I want which are popular. I can't watch even the great movie like Titanic let alone the Ballywood movie. I unsubcribed it and never try again. I'm sad to get back my emotion and joy for watching great movies that create a history in entertainment sector of society.
App is good has good reliability but I wish I could have it autoskip intros because I use it on the side while gaming and I hate having to go back to the app to skip intro
"Recently, subtitles are broken they don't appear correctly. Words are missing in many shows in Android. Please rectify it, such as Suits, Civil War etc."
Everything that's on Netflix's should be downloadable to watch at anytime. Most of the good stuff cant be download. Ex. Why can't I download Black Panther to watch while I'm at work. I feel once it hits Netflix we should be able too
They keep raising the base price. Keep it up and I'll just get rid of it and sign back up for cable. Great content but it's not enough to be paying double what we used to.
I love netflix couse no it has no ads but the one thing that make make me piss is that the season or episodes are late like black clover netflix only have 3 season black clover had 4 season now please update all the season and episodes in netflix im tired waiting for another season or episodes.... Please respond here plus sorry for my english i did not learn that much english
"Those ""Leaving Soon"" drama/movie/documentary should be updated earlier in a list to users so we get the chance to see it before it expires. There are so many of them already gone before I realised it was on Netflix!!!! :("
"The movies are good, but they keep cancelling the good shows people like. Now got a notice that come December 19th prices are going up. Stop cancelling shows if your going to raise prices! Love Lucifer and your to cheap to keep that show even with good ratings!!!"
Every single time i pause my show or movie it dose not un pause it freezes then it takes me off it is didn't even close it or click back mabe if this did not happen I would not have said these things but other than this it's good with family movies and shows
must add a feature where one can schedule downloads. Here in South Africa alot of areas dont have fibre or adsl. we have to rely on mobile data which is very expensive. Rates are cheaper beteeen 12 and 5am so if one could set the phones to download during certain then you may get alot more subscribers
hello can somebody please tell im not wasting my money on this .....everyday Netflix keeps telling me something wrong with my device and how it cannot connect to the server....i have a good wifi connection and im using my chromebook and tablet....its not freaking out on my tablet only on my chromebook.......how the hell to fixs this problem...
"App does not work like it used to, lots of little bugs and annoyances. Netflix is good! but app, not so much."
Lots of great shows and movies! For adults and for kids but there is one thing that is really bothering a lot of people including myself Wich is the shows and or movies that are against other religions I think that's very offenseve and should change.
"Many good and popular movies are not there in Netflix and also in my Samsung tab A8 the playback quality is only sd so it looks bad, can you increase the resolution to 4k for all samsung tabs including mine and make the app work properly at landscape"
"I cancelled since downloads do not work, not that I have i time I want to sit and watch show. Bam! my downloads are gone, error message downloads expired. Also I don't like auto subscribed to stuff, pay as you go is my way."
Good app usually but within the last month it stopped keeping my place in an episode. I'll go back to watch and it will toss me back 2-3 episodes. Very irritating.
If the prices keep going up every month i will be forced to cancel my account. I think this app should consider there is people who cant afford high priced things. I think the apps are consider specials for people that are on disability. Netflix says they are low priced not really anymore.
I would've given 5 stars because it usually plays fine but I'm watching a movie that has stopped and started nine times. This stinks. Hopefully they will fix it and I'll change my rating. But right now it stands at 3
"It's very user friendly but it doesn't have many dramas, movies and series anymore. There were many series and dramas that I wanted to watch but it was unavailable."
I have not been able to watch anything for ages! Re installed the app twice! No images being shown when I select something to watch...please help!
"okay so um,I can't find some of the movies and shows on netflix,basically some people who have Netflix has that particular show or movie but me there's nothing,I was searching for the boss baby movie and it wasn't there,quite dissappointed,I don't know why but if you know whats causing it please reply."
"Guys, nice movies but hard to navigate through likes, watched movies, continue watching, going back when in lists, my list, etc, navigation is very annoying."
"Not able to watch movies in screen mirroring on Sony Bravia Tv, please address this issue. as other movies app provide this feature like amazon prime. thanks"
When it works its great... but some shows I watch are dark...like my brightness is turned down (but isnt). Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it didn't help!
"There is a glitch. When I pick up a call or open another app from notification, netflix plays the video in the background."
"I love the app and has so many great shows, but the reason I gave it a 3 is because they remove all the good stuff and add really bad stuff and like there aren't alot of things to watch rn like I watched almost all the movies and tv shows"
Overall good. But sometimes it can not align with audio and subtitles. Specially in a non-English movies.
When you don't get the I N F I N A T E B U F F E R glitch this app is better than using chrome (sometimes). The ads even when you pay for them not to be there still pop up from time to time and make you wanna reenact Curt Kobain.
"The app was fantastic until recently when I logged in on my new One Plus 8T, the app takes forever to launch. Have tried reinstalling and everything else. Any suggestions please how to fix it?"
Only half video is displayed when I paused the video and open some other app and come back again.netflix team please look into this issue .As a tester I want to report this issue
"Amazing!!, but it takes all my Godamn money. And for a reason my account got blocked or something. Until I found I need to pay MONTHLY LOL. But sometime it GLITCH Alot that says my wifi is bad so sometimes it doesn't even load or I can watch something."
"I used to love Netflix but now I'm not so sure there's more programmes/movies that aren't even in English, so I wouldn't recommend Netflix atm, need more shows and movies in English tbh."
"App works just fine, content has gone down hill a lot in the last years. Recent changes and media mean its not a valuable service anymore."
"everytime I disconnect from wifi and connect wifi back after few mins, I have to restart the app for it to detect Chromecast. please fix this bug. I am using one plus 7"
"The ""Are you still watching..."" feature is the most annoying experience I have when watching a series. I can press stop if I want to stop watching."
"I love Netflix, but I am having issues with the sound cutting out. Has anyone else had these issues? Netflix is the only station that does this."
I don't see all added movies in the list in the Android app but able see in windows. Why I can see only few of the movies in the list? And also I am unable see the movies in the search results also which are visible in windows
"good app, be alot better if the movies stated if they were in english or not can be annoying if you have selected a movie and your all ready to relax and watch only to find its on another language."
"Why do you guys often takedown the upcoming content from the 'coming soon' tab?? I've been using netflix since ages but the way you try to decieve is too bad. You post the upcoming movies all of a sudden, you take them down and never release it. Why so??"
"Was locked out for 8 months in 2018, but problem resolved last new year's day. Wish someone would have let me know it was as easy as deleting and redownloading the app."
"Last update wouldnt let you change ur screen brightness which was kind of annoying, generally good, doesnt always have what you're looking for."
I like the app but I usually use mirror share with my samsung smart TV so as to watch from a screen but not with Netflix when I try to mirror the picture will play on my phome and sound on my TV and the Tv screen becomes black and only show subtitles üòï
Rotates only in one landscape orientation which is so annoying when I need it to rotate otherwise. Not high but standard video quality.
"I'm using Samsung.Galaxy.M30s device and whenever Netflix app is clicked, the following error occurs, ""Sorry, we could not reach the Netflix service. Please try again later (-1001)"" Could anyone please help...."
Normally happy with Netflix good streaming platform But my downloads got completely removed for reason I download shows and movies to watch at work but I can't watch them now because they were removed from my download list Im not too happy about that
"I dont know why this is happening but when I install the app, it starts up but when I close it and restart it, it says ""Runtime Exception"" and the app crashes. Please figure out whta this is."
"The video suddenly disappears and then doesn't play again.. have closed the app restarted the phone but nothing helps, only after a long time it works proper again"
It's alright. The movie selection could be better and should also include more TV shows. But Netflix originals are great.
The app needs to add the ability to play trailers for the movies and series that have them. Written descriptions are not always enough.
The app is nice its just that they delete certain things that i was watching and sometimes even though i have the audio on english they speak japanese if you can fix that it would be great
"What the hell....if I'm watching any bollywood series or movie in hindi, then it doesn't always have to show me hindi subtitles whenever English sentence or English dialog comes, it's irritating...i can't even turn it of...bcoz subtitles are already of üòë if i want subtitles I'll turn it on...but this unwanted subtitles i dont want, plzz fix it....i can't concentrate ok scene when subtitles pops up whenever on screen comes english sentences comes or any English dialog comes....plzz fix it"
If the episode's download is expired can't watch even if I'm online. Logic. Smart download isn't working well. Sometimes it try down a previous epi instead the next one. Once this problem start it keeps till the serie's end.
I can't open any account in my phone. It tells me that I have to check if is the right email and the right password but I tried with a lots of accounts that work and it stills keep saying the same. I need some help!
"If you a person that loves watching movies than you'll love Netflix, but they dont give all the movies your looking for and sometimes when you pause your movie and go yo another app, the movie will play by it's self. But they do have great movies"
I love Netflix but on my LG v30+ all HDR looks yellow and dark. SDR content looks good but when I watch YouTube HDR content that looks flawless. Please Netflix fix this issue.
please sort the option to stop subtitles automatically coming on when playing a movie or tv show!!! this is super annoying having to stop it everytime especially when binge watching!
The app and everything is ok. I would like to rate 5 stars if only all of the movies are english sub supported. I am currently living in Japan but a foreigner so it will be really helpful and great if everything has english sub.
"It takes unnecessary time to download and that is very discouraging , it doesn't have those powerful south African shows and it is anti-diverse . It seems luke like the shows are for sustain types of people."
"The description never says where the film originated. So it has to be opened, check the audio to see if it will be in English. I don't do well with subtitles."
"Why if i open netflix, always says device failure? My phone is the new one. Before that netflix ask for restart the app. After the restart my download film is missing, but my storage is full, n i can't download anymore."
"Most of the time, when I try to open Netflix, I m greeted with an error 1023 and I am unable to access Netflix, this happening frequently nowadays."
I loved this app until the update and it whenever I try to watch a movie or show it says on the screen that 'this title is not available instantly' which is humiliating....pls fix this problem!!!
"Netflix is kinda good cuz you can see all movies and series and all but it kinda sucks when you have to sign up and all and I freaking hate it when it says ""sorry, something went wrong"" like what when wrong bro?"
"Very annoyingly a lot of times its only with blank screens with sound. Cleared data/ cache, reinstall the app still doesn't work. Frustrating"
Remind me again why I cant watch some show movies on one device but on the other I can. Particularly the other device is my phone. Why aren't all the shows showing on my phone when everything is updated? Is it because I'm in another country or what's up with it
"Best app for me ..but I'm having problem,I sign out and I wanted to sign in,I couldn't sign in again..and before I was not be able to sign in ,I changed payment method and it was difficult for me,now I'm using my friends phone...and my happy is that I met MUBRAQ88HATHACKER at GMAIL,,COM..on the comments and he helped me caught my cheating spouse,being able to read my spouse text messages remotely."
"When are u gonna fix the update payment info problem?? I have tried every means posibble and still when I try to update payment it says ""web page unavailable"" and for the record I have high speed broadband connection of 100 mbps... its really irritating... I was gonna give 5 stars but of this problem I am gonna rate it 2.5..."
There should be an option to change profile lock by giving the profile passcode only. If in a shared subscription one people open others' profile and give the regular account password then they can see the profile passcode. What's the point of having a profile lock then? And one locked profile's viewing activity should be accessible only after giving the passcode only.
"The app its self is good, but on my chromebook, the sub titles get cut off, and it's pretty hard to understand a show thats in a foreign language."
"Not working in my Chromecast. Chromecast works perfectly on YouTube, Spotify, and HBO Go. Just not Netflix. Not just me but the whole household."
App keeps loading without actually open a page
there is a no option of zooming in or out according to our need and video quality setting. not all mobiles have same screen size or data limit.
It's great I can watch my stuff without a lot of interruptions but they need to make it an offline streaming app because it keeps buffering when im not connected to internet
"The price goes up while the quality, variety & selection goes down. It causes issues & when you have to reinstall it wont."
"After update, my netflix video freezes but audio is still running and mobile gets hang for a while.. Any idea when it will get fixed.."
Something is wrong with the last update. Video stops itself or minimizes without any command. This is highly annoying.
"Some shows really beed to be updated e.g. steven universe has season 1, 4 and 5. Bit difficult to catch up. Abd lucifer is only season 4, i want to watch this stuff all the way through please. But its all good quality and has most subtitles done well enough"
The app is currently working fine for me but I feel like there's a lot of content that I as a Zambian need to see but it's not available. And I how they could put music videos too üòú
"I Thought In netflix all series,movies are available but not ...game of thrones,flash and the hobit this type of popular series and movies are not available so why can try Netflix? Streaming are good and see without any problem that nice Please put all streaming series,movies..."
it was good at first but your movie selection is getting pretty boring not many A list movies and the movies you do have arent worth watching. ill say some of your netflix originals are good just wished your movie choices get better
I am very happy with my experience except one thing which irritates me a lot. The subtitles are not same as the audio in most of the content.
Some of the series are not only upto season 1..and all the seasons are not available because of the region we live in..hence I think it doesn't make sense even to upload the first season as the curiosity dies there. Unhappy with that one ..strongly
"Keeps crashing. Some shows are brilliant, some dead boring. The download feature is a lifesaver."
Trying to move forward or backward while watching anything is out dated. Would give 5 stars if I could swipe to fast forward and rewind. MX player is a great example
Only issue I have is you should be able to customize what types of shows the app suggests better. I keep having shows and movies pop up that are in languages I dont even speak as watch suggestions. Why would I watch something in a language I dont even speak or understand?
"Netflix you can do better than this.. I subscribed to netflix for more asian content as in dramas and movies they don't have them as they charge..!! Korean dramas are missing the really big ones and thai, japanese all of them are very less for example the drama faith it's not there personal taste is also missing.."
The 'Skip Intro' button should be available on the notification screen (will be better on lockscreen) for the easy access. Applicable only when casting.
"The network is great it totally deserve a 5stars, now here is my worry, seriously i dont understand netflix, i always thought it was an app that had almost all dramas and series available, so am kinda really dissapointmented becuz am a huge fan of kdramas, but to my dismay alot of them are not available on netflix, am really heart broken"
"I love this app, but everytime I try and watch Icarly and i finish the whole seasons of it they dont have the rest of it on Netflix so i cant really watch all of it, who ever made this app plz make the whole seasons of icarly be on there and as well as henry danger too and other ones that need the full seasons of itüôÑüíú"
I've had Netflix for a while now and love it and then all of a sudden I can open it at all I've uninstalled and reinstalled and still it wont open. I'm feeling very frustrated
"App won't allow local downloads at the moment. Since that's basically the only reason I use it, I give it a 3. Just keeps saying not available for download despite displaying the download icon. Boo!"
The payment system is v poor lots of bugs...it says upadte your payment and then it's not accepting the card payment and not even showing me the option to change the payment method....Pathetic...I had to create another account to make the payment..
"Well, having access to Nexflix,it's like a window to the entertainment, with movies & programs. You know very well that will have a good time."
"I love Netflix,though after 4yrs of having it seams there is just not enough new decent things to watch an there are way to many movies an shows not in English.. I struggle to find stuff I havnt seen to watch."
"I am increasingly experiencing that My TV switches off using Netflix. Certain programs simply turn my TV off. Example Restless, Inventing Anna, Worst roommate ever, just to name a few. No other service is doing this. I am seriously thinking of cancelling my subscription."
all the shows and movies are great but the the money you lose by being able to watch those shows slowly builds up and the price for Netflix is slowly rising
"You get an ERROR msg box often times while trying to open. Other times, you get a msg box -Unable to play this title now. Also most of the series are _SPANISH_ either dubbed in English or with subtitles."
The length of time between seasons for Netflix originals can be absurd. Commit to 3 and shoot them or don't. Stringing along your clients is rude and unexceptable.
"Netflix really need to support split screen or picture in picture. HBO, Hulu and YouTube can all split screen why can't Netflix."
"I have to restart my phone very often to use Netflix, it has become pretty useless on Android, please fix this. The service is good but the app is bad."
"When viewing ""Coming Soon"" the App glitches, goes to black screen then returns to normal operation. When this happens my newly selected Reminders unset and have to be reselected."
Since the last update I'm not able to screenshare from my phone to the Chromecast device. It's not nice to watch movies from the phone.
I'm having a problem with watching anything or chosing accounts when I'm connected to a WiFi. I only can use the app with my Mobile Data and it costs me a lot. Could you please help me with that issue. Thanks.
"Since the last update the cast ""button"" Is no longer available on screen before starting to watch?? What happened? Really annoying to have to start a show on my phone to access the ability to cast! Please fix this ASAP!"
Not that impressed barely adequate don't have enough movies like 2020 movies already there were in the theaters like Wonder Woman 84 I don't want to have to pay for it I already paid for subscription. You're lucky I gave it three stars I was thinking on giving it to and a half but it didn't have such a thing
Netflix was working great until I did a update now it keeps on crashing. This sucks so much for the update. You know its my falt anyway. Maybe if it is working stop trying to make it better.
"Actually it is not pretty bad don't get me wrong it is vverryy cool the thing which made me give it 3 stars is that sometimes years pass and still they don't download the new episodes such as my favourite cartoon ""ninjago"" there are ALOT of seasons not down such as ""season 3, season 4, season 5, season 6, season 9, season 10, season 11, and season 12"" and i got sick of checking out EVERY SINGLE DAY if the new episodes are down. What i wanna say is please put them down and i will be VERY THANKFUL"
With the most recent update it took away the blue light filter feature on my note 10? Like what's the point of controlling what setting we use please fix this.
The videos keep seizing while audio continues playing. This has affected the quality of the app. Please fix this. And add recent movies please
It's a big issue my downloads become expired after and before watching .
I LOVE Netflix. I just cant get enough. But lately my account has has captions on. I've turned it off in the settings and nothing. Please help me.
Me and my friend took Netflix account for the first time and it was mentioned that you give free 30 days trial to the subscribers and the payment starts from the following month but we didn't got that free trail and our money got deducted directly from the first month. IDK what is the issue but We feel disappointed. Please tell us what is it. Waiting for your reply.
Playback speed control removed. Would rate 5 if restored. This is the USP of Netflix. When not there it has to compete with the likes of Amazon prime or hotstar
"Please include language details in the info. If I want to watch a movie, I do not know that in which languages it is available, until we play the movie. So it is better to include ""available language"" in the info section along with cast and genres."
"The quality of the pictures is not good .....I wanna adjust it to hd but there's no option like that... please correct this I wanna watch all the movie's, series and shows in hd quality"
App was great but now it won't connect to my Roku tv by casting without launching Netflix on the TV first. Sort of defeats the purpose.
The app for some reason just stops working for me I always have to uninstall in order to watch something hopefully it can start working soon if not I have to cancel my subscription.
The app works well my only complaint is there isn't enough on it. The American Netflix has way more on it. I've already watched everything on it and the only reason I still have it is to keep the children happy
Keeps going too dark when trying to watch episodes. Keep having to reinstall. Darkness is auto so can't adjust. Bug in app.
Is anyone else experiencing subscription issues in the last couple of days? I can't watch anything until I correct or update my payment information. I've checked both accounts and there is more than enough to cover my payment plan. What's going on here?
"Netflix ""we're raising our prices"" Me "" oh you mean you're gonna charge me more than Amazon prime where I can watch shows, movies, and have stuff brought to my doorstep with 2 days notice, no thanks! Hope you lose money on this one"" besides I binged everything you had that's worth watching when I had covid."
Picture and sound quality really superb. Most of Cartoon/Hollywood dubbed movie is available only in Hindi... You should consider other regional languages also.
Netflix is great! It's just that this app doesn't work well on Android. You should fix that. I use Netflix on my TV and laptop no problem.
Over all its good with UI and all the options but the only draw back is it's draining the battery very fast compare to other applications like Amazon Prime and zee apps pls look into it other than that every thing looks good üëç
Ok now I just noticed that Netflix does not give their services equally. The series am watching has all it's episode released in other countries and while in my country( my account) I still have to wait for weeks and months.. I want to ask why is it like that when I pay the exact money like others ?
"Great but it won't let me connect unless I'm on wifi, and I prefer mobile data because it's faster here. I used to be able to watch through mobile data."
The app's conceptual model can take a hike. Seriously it hurts my brain when I use it. Especially that stupid preview that plays whenever I try to play the episode I want. ü§Ø
"Netflix Sometimes you have good things to watch but sometimes there's nothing and nobody uses it, so can you fix that and add more movies !!!"
Good app but there is some issue with brigthness setting. Even thought i set maximum brightness in app it is not enough too watch movies (i see that phone brightness is set to half of max value but i can not increase it as Netflix app block it)
"Free app? It's free to see the lineup of shows you could watch if you had Netflix. However, I do have Nexflix and if I were to install the app on my phone my subscription rate would immediately increase."
I am facing a lot of glitches in Netflix whenever I am watching something the video stops but the audio continues to play no matter what I do to resolve it kindly look into it
"I keep getting a device failure notification. I've powered down, restarted my phone. Uninstaller and re-installed the app. Same issue. Please advise"
"Shows that I've just watched the night before are now removed. Contacted customer service- says they are ""sorry about it"" but assured me thr show is available in my area. I've un-installed and re-installed.. it appears then the next day is gone! What the heck"
It's a great app but it keeps saying that the title is not available to watch instantly and that I should try another one soo I was wondering maybe you can fix that problem for me thnx.
Well but not well Aal the time they are saying that updated payment but when we are going to update it doesn't happen because when I am gonna updated with another card it's not working they are asking for again and again but suddenly when we put CVV code in the box it's suddenly hide other wise when we are watching movies and show its good
"Hi Netflix Developers, From my last update i am getting error that your service cant be reach now, I already try every option available in your forum but still its not working. Everytime I have to reinstall the app to entertain myself. Please work out."
*Incomplete seasons for most tv shows. *Smart download feature does not automatically delete watched episodes when there is no more new epsode to download and replace watched episodes.
This update 7.71.0 giving me headache when i stop watching something and close app and when i return it doesn't start from where i leave it start from anywhere i watched sometimes it even starts from previous episode its so frustrating please check it and let me know whats happening I'll change my review and back to 5 stars
Range of films could be improved as can the clumsy navigation. The app also seems to be tempremental at times.
just download it today an cant even find it on the tablet - if i want to use i need to iopen play store n get the app this way unsure in this why is - i have an s7 tablet
"Sometimes, I encounter error while playing video. No matter what I do videos don't play at all. Also preview auto play doesn't play during this error. Please resolve this issue ASAP"
"I'm having tech issue. While my video is playing and I lock my screen, after some mins audio automatically starts playing while screen is locked. Please get it fixed asap"
I really like this app. i give it 3 stars becaise i am an existing customer and i have been trying to pay my bill for 2 days amd it keeps saying website error. i cant log in to the actual website either. its so frustrating because i really want to watch movies
"Good content, quality, and interface. Couple of cons are brightness and repetitive crashing (especially when using pip)."
Not a bad app fun movies and shows to get addicted for hours on end binge-watching your favorite new shows prices could be better though but a good as all the other apps around but with new stuff coming out all the time to enjoy
the app is nice overall but the app is not opening on my Chromebook and this only started a few days ago please fix.everything else on my laptop works perfectly fine except Netflix.
"I'm sorry I can't update the ''app"" even I tried it again and again over and Over. It still doesn't and the movie that's long it takes an hour and it gives me a minute to watch the movie like Bruhhhh if you make the movies longer I would make the Stars full rates thank you for understanding"
Getting real tired of all Netflixes 1 season shows. What's the point of watching and getting attached when you have no intention of completing the story.
If i compare it with Amazon prime app Netflix is much better than that because of content but on other side as compared with subscription Netflix is expensive .... Netflix should low their price or package ......
I am also having the same problem on my Huawei. The video starts then stops then starts then stops and continues on. I also get randomly logged out then it takes forever to log in. It was working perfectly 3 days ago. Please address this.
App keeps bringing up the play menu during a video as if I am touching the screen but I am not at all. This only occurs with this app.
I would've given it a 5 but lately it's been glitching and not working when I play my show. But aside from that it's a great app for movie and series.
Why does it seems awful I watched it finished about 30 minutes and I tried entering back but kept going back I uninstalled it and now it isn't installing anymore
Its a good app.. but problem is that they are slow in bringing new episodes and lots of movies and tv shows that my friends can watch in UK and USA doesnt show in Germany... why???????
Smart download doesn't always work ... can't change subtitle options in app!! Changed sub appearance in browser but no effect on app.
"It feels like cheated!spending handful of money it's waste if u don't release popular shows seasons as day it's released!! Months have passed as Ozark, walking dead new seasons have been released, but we r rated like fools!! It's really testing my patience & money I would prefer to uninstall Netflix & try amazon for other web series"
It was working great but then it would play for 1 second and pause. I reinstalled same result. I will cancel my subscription after this month. $20 is a lot to pay when there are so many free sites.
"Need better selection of movies because I don't see alot of decent films anymore I would really appreciate if you added movies like ""A Dogs Way Home"", ""Family Guy"", ""American Dad"" and other like that because I find the selection of good films and series quite poor."
"Keeps telling me I need to delete my downloads, but I don't have anything downloaded. I cleaned the cache then it works for 2 days and then we start all over again. If it keeps doing this I will cancel my account."
I agree with the people that the price keeps going up you need to add more movies for the price we are paying if it doesn't change I am also going to cancel Netflix thank you
Its an ok app but i wish you put the whole season and not taking animes and tc shows and movies away plus i would give you a five star but i feel like you get a 3 star why bc it bugs me that theres only like one or two seasons of the anime so i would like it if you put the whole season in there and put more animes plss some are just not i like so that would be good
Was working great. but recently have been having problems with it crashing on my laptop and now it doesn't want to start on my new Samsung Notebook. Please fix it and then I will give stars like it used to deserve.
"The app and service are great, however whenever I prepare downloads for some offline periods, something happens that invalidate the downloads or the files and it never works offline."
"The gestures within the player is not well built like tapping and sliding gesture, the visual controls hover over the content and is annoying many times"
"After shutting down phone and turning it back on, the subtitle settings reset. This happens after ive finished charging up my phone."
Whenever I try to log in either on my phone it says that my information is incorrect which I doubled checked to make sure that it wasn't. It's has been the same information I've been using since I created my account. I have no idea what's going on but I need some help.
"I'd hoped for a wider range of movies; especially decent horror films. Though the variety altogether is nice, I'd like an update on more horror."
"The update is bs. It always crashes, and when I resume my shows, it's not the exact time. Very pissed about the update."
"Well you know its netflix, one of the best thing is plathora of content to watch. Well one thing i surely want is rating of all the content before watching and next thing is trailer. Coz before watching movie i dont want my self to go to youtube to watch trailer. Please add that."
I've been using netflix for so long yet there is still no playback speed option. It is so annoying that i have to watch everything at 1.0
The picture in this app gets stopped automatically and the audio keeps on playing and the picture get blured and spoils the whole interest do something with this problem and fix the bugs
"SD Card download is not working. When I try to enable it, it defaults back to internal. Other apps are working, and the card is showing active in my settings."
Netflix for the past three day now after finish downloading my movies to watch later it just delect while watching. Before i know they will say something went wrong please fix it.
Great movies streaming just sucks we cant control app brightness according to what we want. Would have been nice if it would just stick to phones display settings instead of having one on its own
Evetytime I watch it the screen goes really dark and hard to watch anything. Adjusted my settings and nothing will brighten the screen. Irritating.
If the price goes up much more.... Im going to have to switch back to cable.... it all adds up. The convenience is starting to wear off
"Netflix need to work in it. Lot of times it won't open, or get stuck on the home page. Won't allow to select the option, restarts a lot.ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Not worthy@ rate of 8k per year. Hollywood blockbuster movies like terminator, mad max etc.. is not available on this. Also not much regional or hindi movies are not available on this big platform. Clarity of video is best. Casting options is also best."
Right now whenever we are going to download GTA san andreas Netflix from Play Store it is showing your device is not compatible with this version even we have full compatibility of our devices I have attach my device about section please check out and fix the problem thousands of people are facing the same issue please solve this I have attached as soon as possible fix this problem
"Netflix Is Awesome I wish You have options like date saving, Downloading videos Even U have multiple Devices on a particular device, And a survey That (what should we add ). And In TV Only Show The movies or Shows which have Nice Poster (that we can see infront of Family"
"Nicd user friendly app, but often it spoils the best storylines with the preview pictures of the episodes or of the series in the main menu."
"The new shuffle button is a big problem, and covers the pause/play button. Can't resume play without restarting."
When I try to get back at the last episode that I watched it will take me to a different one. It was accurate before but now I need to manually look for the actual episode where I left off. Kindly fix this.
Having been off for sometime I can no longer access the movies I had downloaded and everytime I try to access Netflix it's asking me sign in but it can't even load kindly fix that problem
The screen freezes or goes full black whilst the audio keeps playing in the back. Its annoying as hell. Kindly fix this problem
"I love Netflix! but.. the ""My List"" function is not working on my phone. I can't add or delete things from ""My List"". This is not very good."
"Don't really use it since I üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è but from what I've seen it's okay. It came predownloaded on my phone and it had someone's account on it, but I didn't have the password so it was useless."
Please allow us to backup Netflix data via helium backup. I have tons of downloaded seasons and some movies and I don't want to waste my time redownloading them again in my new phone. Please allow it. Thank you üòä.
"Overall good, but you need to add payment through mobile bill in netflix bangladesh. That'd make the payment method way easier in this region as people here prefer the that way of payment more than credit card payments."
"Such a pathetic app, to find payment process, even a one star app has clear payment options"
Not much excites me on Netflix but I am trying to keep an open mind
"Movies are not consistant. Example, maze runner has 3 movies. But netflix only shows number 2. So if we want to watch 1 and 3 we have to go somewhere else. So whats the point in paying it? Could jus watch free online..."
"Netflix is a good app but it doesn't have series like the vampire diaries, the originals,pretty little liars or teen wolf. i think the app would be better with those series."
"Good but the increase in price does not justify the return,a customer must be satisfied completely with what they pay for and not dictated by what they get,it is still advertised at R149 but get debited at R199,if this is the case,most customers might not be too happy,we need a direct communication with the suppliers of this service and there should be customizable packages available,why should one pay for everything when you used only one tenth of it,also data charges should be dropped double"
Hoping Netflix developers will see this post. Please make it so that while browsing for a movie or series that I don't see titles that I watched already (that are in my view history). #RFC #FeatureRequest #Netflix @Netflix
HD downloads is not supported on my Chromebook.
will not load. i always us the app on my tablet and this past week it sucks. will not load. so frustrated. can anyone give me some feedback on why this is happening all of a sudden this past week. is it going to get fixed I hope so.
I have had this app for years and before year to their increase they do another increase doesnt fit my budgetwith continued increasing so gotta deactive my account like some shows and some movies but recently not liking their selection of movies
Massive battery drain whilst using app. 35% of my battery used and hot phone while casting a show for just one hour. Screen is off whilst casting. Please fix.
"Gave download option for 1 season to check download size. Then cancelled and decreased the video quality to download again, it says download limit reached wait for next billing cycle. There ain't gonna be no billing cycle."
"Whenever I see video I did not see any video quality options. Bcz sometime we have less data, so then we choose low or medium quality. So please do something about this.... Thnkx"
"It is an amazing app to watch movie on but as a hole it is getting worse and worse as movies and series have been removed to add ""game"" and ""quick laughs"" these are cool features and all but maybe stick to the basic movies and TV shows/ series"
Subtitles are not included when I turn PIP. And the small screen cannot be resize. ): I have a Realme andorid. I hope you can add those fetures to my phone type.
"If a user has the app cast and it's stopped at the ""are you still watching"" screen, and another user then casts to take over the screen, the app & cast freeze and you gotta restart the process"
"Would appreciate it if you could have Chinese dubbed Anime, especially done by the Taiwanese. The expression is more relevant. Thank you"
I had Netflix installed on my android and it was working alright until today it won't open if I try to open it . I have to uninstall and install yet still it's not working. I'm frustrated please fix it . What's the problem?
"After i updated tha app just now, it says i cant download movies any more because it says i have too many downloads in other devices. I am very sure that i only have this one device where netflix is installed"
Honestly I tolerate netflix... they take off shows you really enjoy and I dont see a point then... I remember a time when it used to be $8.00 for the whole service that they provide...now its $15.00 üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ
I tried downloading and changing password just to have to keep repeating the same process for over a hour now this don't make no sense at all and then ot days account exists use different email
"Everything I try to watch keeps freezing or very laggy, they need to resolve this issue. About to cancel my service!!!!"
I m a netflix user since an year.. i had no issues since yesdy...now i cant open my netflix app..üò¢they are saying some device error ..i really enjoyed watching in it . Plz help ..
"Why shows like naruto are not complete. There are only 10 seasons. If you can't upload full shows, then you should not upload it."
Lags when loading ~~ its starting to upset me. Everytime i want to watch my shows it tells me there is a network problem ive tried all of the ways to prevent this from happening and none work please make it stop! I just want to watch my showwww
Same stuff over and over. And is to high in price. They need to keep it at $8 a mounth. And have a online store where people can buy therer videos that they own.
App is great and quality too but after exit it starts playing in background. Sign out is necessary so that it doesn't play automatically.
"I desperately try to change my payment method from 3rd party payment. I stop my subscription from that 3rd party payment but, I can't add a new payment method. Gosh! I'm frustrated!"
"I dont have problem with the app , just the content as , specially netflix india , it has a very limited amount of content like 70 percentage of movies i search for is not there.."
If their can be an option to select video quality while watching. That would be good like every other app in the app store!
I can't play the gta because I have a 4g and it a won't work I need a older device it said and I'm try every day but won't your
"Awesome documentry and movies with awesomee caption ... 1.But when i payement i worried about our privacy therefore you take full detail of my account as well as my atm pin also .... When it leak, it is most dangerous for all users.... 2. You need to add more option for payement you are not accepted RUPAYE CARD ....why????"
My only problem is having the app control my brightness. There needs to be a way to turn off this feature or at least match the brightness my screen was already set to.
"I love Netflix, however, I have te $12.99 package, yet I cannot download any movies to the only tablet (Hisense) I have with HDMI capabilities to watch it on my tv! Why? 5 stars in all other devices' but for thiss tablet 1 star"
"I love netflix it has lots of shows and movies to pick. But netflix AWAYS canceled the good shows and it's soo annoying, like you be enjoying a good show and then you find out it canceled. So netflix stop canceled all the good shows"
Having problems with the app. Freezing and not showing downloads needed to uninstall and reinstall. Has problems connecting to internet as well.
"These days Netflix is not able to update the recent episode I watched, it goes back and start the episode I have already watched. It ignores the current status of my watch list."
"The app is good. However please update your payment methods to include upi/bhim payments or include other cards in your payment method. Making payments is a huge hassle. All I am asking is, please make it easier to make me give you my money."
App isn't allowing for search between episodes. It's locking me in on the wrong one. The screen won't search up and down like it should within app
Netflix is amazing ott app but you need to add more language to watch movies example : amazing spider man movie is dubbed in multiple languages but I can see only two languages so if the movie is available in 5 language add the other language too
"Great app, but have been stumble upon difficulties lately. Said that the movie i tried to warch can't be access immediately. Have to reinstall the app several times"
"Cannot play at TV, always need permission when play at TV"
"Good app, adding to many features though and it's getting confusing. (As to why, and the nessenarity of doing so is unreasonable.) Also should add more shows - options"
"For some reason the app is unable to run , reinstalled couple of times but everytime it shows error. kindly look into it."
Its gud! But recently there's a problem in watching downloaded episodes and Idk why it is happening as I didn't face any problem in Netflix earlier days!üòû I have almost 1.3GB downloaded episodesüò≠
"I enjoy using the app but since I updated to Android 11 the app hasn't work when I tried to open it just glitches, the screen turns black and it closes."
"For the amount it cost, I shouldn't struggle as much as I do with bugs constantly to the app just closing for no reason many times I've had to leave the app closed for hours before it'll actually load."
The app usually works fine but it keeps crashing and telling me I'm using a proxy or unblocker even though I'm not using any of those so I keep having to uninstall the app and installing it again its really inconvenient
"Overall ifhts a nice app,however,I keep on seeing foreign device in my account,I can't remove this so called devices that keep on stealing my Netflix subscription,pls fix this,it's very annoying."
"WHY ARE THERE SO MANY FOREIGN MOVIES WITH SUBTITLES?!? Revised:All of the sudden, FINALLLY, dubbed in english for those of us roaming but listening üòç! Afraid I can't raise rating just yet; it took 2 years for any change... and I like horror moviesü•∫"
Netflix is king of Ott. But it supports only 720p HD in a 1440p mobile device. Please optimize and let the video play fullest to device capability.
"In the past few weeks when I played the videos/episode in netflix it keeps changing into minimum size after a couple of times Please fix this, keep your hard works, thank you"
It's great until your account gets hacked and they were store it in all of your preferences in watch history is gone for multiple users and they can't restore it and they blame you.
Frustrated that the app controls the brightness of my device. I can hardly see the screen in a brightly lit room during playback.
Netflix you're messing up. If you're gonna do this LGBTQ mess for kids you need to put the option for filters in it just like PG13 and everything else. That way I could keep the kids profile up with little worries. So please put the filter option up on that mess or else we gonna have problems. Until than my kid can't watch Netflix without me and the streamlinng levels are going down because you can't put parental filters options up for stuff my kids not ready for.
"I am trying my very hardest to get Netflix to recognise that I'm using both my phone and tablet on the same WiFi account! I have emailed,phoned but still no joy! Come on Netflix I'm in a studio flat..."
The latest update is absolutely awful. Recently every time I open the app I just close it and go elsewhere because I need to be searching down the place to simply continue what I was watching. It is not user friendly. At all.
"I would give this a 5 star but it doesn't have that many shows on it. And I hate that some of the shows have to be political, sexual, and sometimes strait up stupid and a waist of your time. By the way why do other countries have way cooler shows then this one?"
"The playback option isn't working properly. Once the playback is paused, you cannot play it again. It just doesn't work. Please fix the bug"
"I like it a lot but my screen is too small to watch it on my phone or tablet As for my TV I did have it for a long time...now it's just too expensive, I'm on Disability"
I don't know it was working great but last weak it had stopped working and logging out again and again and send me messages that your server is not working otherwise its a great app I hope u fix this problem
Netflix stop taking down all the good shows and movies! I'm getting so annoyed by shows and movies I can't find anywhere else being taken down!
"I am currently hating the app because it does not seem to understand that when one pays not all the five profiles are in use by one person and people are not always close enough to the one who pays to get the verification from them and even after saying that its not my profile it tells me to that I can my a plan and have five accounts which is nota solution, I also sign out then sign back in but it keeps asking t9he same thing kindly address the issue bcoz its rather annoying"
The app is really great but pls some series seasons ain't complete for example hero academia stopped at season 2 on Netflix meanwhile it has up to 5 seasons Please I'll really appreciate it if the remaining seasons of hero academia will be available I know you guys won't take my request seriously but please grant my request
Why doesn't it download ALL EPISODES!!! of a series when I download it!?!? This is utterly impractical and not understandable AT LEAST give a quick link to the series in downloads to download the rest and don't let me SEARCH FOR IT AGAIN TO OPEN IT ANS CLICL EVERY FREAKONG EPISODE
"This is so irritating, in some places video stops and only audio comes. Most irritating thing is that when it happens between a crucial part"
Something's up with the new update. The playback is not working and a movie restarts itself everytime I restart the app.
"Suddenly, the Maximum Playback Resolution shows SD on my OnePlus 7 Pro. I have watched HD content previously on same device with same subscription!! L3 L1 Widevine looks like messed up! Please fix it."
The only issue I have is the lighting. The screen is so dark even light all the way up to see a lot of scenes in especially movies based at night
App keeps crashing since yesterday evening every time i click on the tabs at the bottom.... Can't believe this is Netflix!!!!!
"Downloads are 50/50. Always get an error message when clicking play after downloading. Sometimes works fine, sometimes doesn't."
I enjoy da Movies. I just dont like that alot of them lately r in different languages an you cant change it to English when you go to Audio an Subtitles.
This update is awful! When I'm resuming a movie the screen is just black and sometimes the screen freeze but the audio is fine!
"Meh..... sometimes I wonder why I actually pay for this app. For one thing, you can't even tell what are the foreign language films/shows. Wish I could filter them out, as I have no interest in them. And I don't like how they have things ""classified."" I do like some of their originals though. That's really why I keep the app. We'll see......"
"Quality is really bad. I mean come on, just update the player. Im on youtube watching vids 720p60 but you mean to tell me im paying for your highest subscription and can only watch in SD 480p because my device isnt supported by your HD features?? btw im on a Samsung J8"
Don't know why but the app never remembers where you left off on a show or film that you have downloaded and starts them from the beginning. This wasn't a problem in the past but it definitely is now.
"How to change subtitle appearance on android? I've been try to change it like on pc, but it doesn't works. I can't read the subtitle while the movie on the bright screen, pls fix it. Thanks."
mobile app is minimize after some time while cast on Chromecast. each time we have to open application and select profile in mobile to skip intro or jump on next episode.
"It is bettet if netflix provides a 2√ó speed,It really save a lot of time to watch mv.Besides,I really hv no idea why it takes a longer time to operate in android compared to iosüòÇ"
Having issues with picture in picture mode. It's allowed in my phone but when I try to run the picture in picture while watching anything on Netflix it doesn't support and gets shut.
It is good but it can be be better. I remember before they used to put new movies. Now the majority of the movies that Netflix is putting are movies from like 8 to 10 years old. They only put new movies that Netflix make.
I love netflix. The shows are amazing and I love how yoy put different countries dramas bc I am a kdrama fan. The only problem that I have is that with korean shows the songs are not the actually songs that they are singing and some parts are cut.
"App is generally fine, but why am I suddenly getting multiple notifications per day even though I have them disabled in the app settings? Had to block them at the OS level to make it stop."
"The app is generally good, but there needs to be an option to turn off the autoplay of trailers. Mighty annoying."
"Overall, sort of a good app, but... sadly, it doesn't know the difference between donghua and anime, which is chinese and japanese. Donghua is a chinese animation while anime is a japanese animation."
So Nexflix used to work pretty good and I would've given it 5 stars but for some reason it plays audios to shows I haven't seen when I log into my computer and it glitches every few seconds. Am I the only one seeing this?
"Facing issues these days like , 1.App gets crashed out of no where, 2.Double tap on screen keep showing all froward reverse buttons, 3. lock feature have glitch as it didnt get unlock, I had to close app and open again for that. Slove issues please"
"look it's pretty good, but recently my star wars the clone wars has gone missing, I even searched for it and it was gone. why do you remove stuff when people still watch them. for the exclusion of the star wars I have given a 3 star instead of 5 star. add it back and the new seasons that are comming too! now Netflix is boring.... for now....."
"Now nothing is there to watch. It's too boring. Hence, discontinued the subscription. Moreover, most of web series have been discontinued which is really frustrating."
number of screens available for netflix is 4 but sometimes 5 or 6 screens occupied by people. This is a bug in this application and should be fix.
"Seems to suffer from a stuttering issue. Issue is intermittent, almost seems to depend on what content you watch."
Display issue on realme c55 can't able to see anything only black screen but audio perfectly coming.. many times I tried to fix but It doesn't work . One time erasing all data then it's start working but now again the same issue.
"Usually excellent, but lately the shows I'm watching have the picture freeze up and I have to restart ever 10 seconds if I want to watch the show ....."
I can watch series and movies at ease but i cant watch everything. I hope that netflix and the developer will consider adding every movie they had.
"mid experience, used to be really good but now idk what happened. some of the episodes shows arent even released on netflix even though its been months. they remove the only tv shows that are good."
Good but this app without permission repayment
"When watching content, the on-screen controls can't be dismissed with a tap. Instead, you must wait for the controls to go away by themselves."
"It's a really awesome app, the only problem is when you use it on mobile you can't get the trailer for all the movies which is a bit annoying."
Netflix is a good app don't get me wrong but like it's always that one movie/show that's popular like squid game but then that's it like the rest of the movie/shows are not that good/interesting.
Good but why do we have to pay for this and then still use wifi to stream it a lot of wifi consumption to be specific its really annoying. And the screen goes blurry sometimes but Netflix is still good trust me
I can't find most movies that I want to watch on Netflix and that not cool. Like you have part one of a show but the other parts are not on it and also I series that I loved to watch but that's gone too so what should I do
"Netflix is a cool app.. you people have kannada movies in that but we don't see the option for ""kannada"" under the categories.. Please add that option .. And expecting some more kannada movies on Netflix.."
Well i would give you more stars but tubiis user friendly app is better than yours and they have alot of better nainstream movies your movie s are mostly b rated junk movies and i have to pay ??? Another thing you dont have is a bill datewhere i can look at so i never know when its due til u cut it off i really dont know why i still pay ???? Or even have your services
The new interphase is horrendous. You have to keep scrolling just to search the content its so annoying. Please revert to the original interphase
Thought I'd write a review before it got too annoying to write about for some reason when I play a movie the subtitles are on already plz fix thanks üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ
please work on the brightness thing. Even at the lowest the brightness seems too high when binge watching at night in dark.
"For some reason, it shows some new recently added shows but then doesnt allow you to view them. Restarted the app now it says the shows aren't there!?"
I've Been using netflix for a Few months and I used to watch it on tv but now I didn't Find anything How to connect netflix from My phone to the tv because there's no something on netflix that you usually Can connect to the tv. If Anyone know How to do it Please tell me!!!
"Eh. I ALMOST HATE IT. My question is: WHY?! WHY DO YOU GET RID OF EPISODES?!?! IT SUCKS! KEEP THEM PLEASE!!! üò°üò°üò° But................... Otherwise it is alright. And the new episodes where you get to CHOOSE what to do? That part is amazing!! That's why I'm not giving it a 1 or 2 star. If you stop getting rid of videos I like, then 110% you'll get ur five star ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®"
"Hi, App is good. Add to My List isn't working. And new releases aren't coming in the New Release section, but appearing in the search."
Try to add more k dramas to the app
"the version keep showing error 101.1.8 on NOTE 9 keep having to delete and re download making me hit my download limit for each episode ridiculous, didnt happen previous. please release a patch update"
"Everything is fine except for the playback specifications, I have a phone with full HD display, before the update netflix app diagnosed Full HD in payback specification part but after latest update it went down to SD and it sucks"
this app is the best thing ever it has millions of movies the inly thing i dont like about this app is that it cant get all of the seasons i just wish that evry movie in the world was on there.like batwoman the rest of heartand and a teenage girl secret life i also wish that switched at birth was on netflix like that is the boring part about netflix you cant watch the movies and tv shows you want to at the time so that is why i give netflix a 3 instead of a five.so thats my review for today bye
"I love netfilx, but please add The Conjuring All parts, Annabelle all parts and The nun all parts in saudi arabia netfilx."
"The app works and there are some good shows on here. Netflix not caving and removing Dave Chappelle was a great thing, but I cannot overlook allowing content such as ""cuties"" on the platform"
"Can somebody really translate if the character is speaking in another language instead of putting 'speaking in Chinese or Korean or other language'. Like, seriously, we call it subtitle for a reason. Thank u."
Good app but many shows are not available in my country. I started free trial because I wanted to watch a series but it's not available in my region but I already started the trial and I am currently not interested in other netflix shows.
Would not recommend even if content is huge there is some critical problems first and most important is lack of language chooses I may understand why there is no Latvian and Russian but English damn it had to be there second lack of seasoning I found gintama it has in German only and it wasn't first season and who ever watching have no idea about it it's not mentioned anywhere
"I like how Netflix always has something for me to watch, last time I said that was in march but ya'll been slacking lately and its because you spend all your time and money on one thing and then turns out not to be good so you realize you should have focused on those other things then when you do it turns out to be trash"
The subtitles have a black highlight which ruins the viewing experience. Not sure why they decided to add the highlight but it's clear no one likes it
"I love this App alot, it's my companion. What i do not like about this App is the fact that after you've used your data to watch a movie u cannot rewatch it again eventhough you've already paid."
Why does the screen freezes so much? It freezes for like 10 seconds and then it's normal even when I have perfect network this happens. Please do something about it.
"I am having issues with the Netflix tv error. Everytime I update it, the app doesn't open on the tv. Internet connection is good enough on the phone"
they ripped us off. we applied a $30 dollar card a week ago. yesterday they put our account on hold saying there was a problem with our payment. i called support. first they said the prices have went up. then i told her we just put on a card a week ago. she said i havent put on one since march 3rd. i assured her we put on the card in april. it accepted it saying thank you for your payment. instead of helping she started getting loud arguing that i havent paid since march 3rd.
The app was not running.. There was some issue. Uninstalled and Reinstaledl it.. And guess what! All the downloaded videos are gone.
Smooth app and decent content but have recently started spamming me with notifications... The share price is dropping with fears of people going out more after lockdown but spamming me with stuff to watch is certainly not going to help favourably in my decision if I think about leaving...
"Please do UPLOAD the movies/series a month or 2 after it was aired. I've been waiting for too long for THE 100's 5th Season which was aired on 2018 and since now, it wasn't still available on netflix and the series already had season 6!"
"this is a great program but , there is a weird problem inoticed that when i searched anime there were only 4 animes there before there were many animes but it all vanished , when i went to google it show me a link and it got me to the show i liked but when i searched again in netflix it isnt there , if you have any solutions please tell me , ps i used a vpn when this happened thank you"
Too much bugs also stops video only voice can runs
"Recent glitch: Shows and movies start from the beginning instead of picking up where I left off, or they go back to the first episode instead of continuing where I was."
"we pay twice as much but we don't get enough content as some other nations.. that's not fare on us..but I must say the experience while watching something is the best.. because of Netflix I cannot use any other streaming service,coz I know I'm not gonna get the same experience."
I can't open Netflix app on our Smart TV even though the connection is quite good. Please have an update for smart tvs to fix this issue.
"Subtitles look worse now, there is no outline to the text at all, it's completely unreadable on white backgrounds."
Its a good app but i only have one problem which is when im watching something ( Im currently watching the US shameless ) sometimes it doesnt show uup on the continue watchimg so i look it up and i cant find it? Its only what im watching tho and then i have to qait for it to show up again. Netflix please fix this its very annoying. Its a very great app otherwise
"is good, but add back blue exorcist"
I am giving Netflix a okay rating because they always take down shows to add new ones I believe if you can add new ones keep the olds one for example :the office parks and recreation etc I loved these shows with all my heart so now I can't watch the best shows
"I enjoy Netflix, but the app keeps crashing on both my daughter's phone and my own. A delete and reinstall hasn't worked as a solution."
"I just recharged my account. Post recharge the app started to crash, I cant open it and use. What is happening, I even tried updating the app. Tried using it with another phone and even on my laptop. Its not working anywhere. Please help me out üò≠üò≠"
it was great for on the go streaming. now the app wont open. i tried uninstalling and reinstalling it with no luck. not sure whats going on.
The app was fine until this last update. Everytime I click on my list it closes the app. I tried reinstalling the app and restarting my phone and it's still doing it
It doesn't has a big collection of movies and tv shows. Would've been much better if it had all movies and TV shows and newly released shows.
Love this app so much but would really love it if we can remove a series or movie we didnt enjoy from the continue watching section..ex: Was watching The 100 and didnt enjoy the later seasons so i would really love to remove it from continue watching..besides that all is good
everything is awesome but they for some reason removed the mighty ducks and the 3 Jurassic Park movies and Thoughes are just the movies I wanted to watch. Netflix if your reading this please bring my favorite movies back
just noticed that videos keep pausing on its own 10-15 seconds gap. my internet connection is just fine. please fix this issue! its so annoying!
"I feel like I'm being ripped off, when I see actors moving their mouths without remembering the script. Like I'm paying $12.00 a month for this? At least remember the script. I'm disappointed with the quality being presented. Come on Netflix orginal?"
"Dear Netflix, your collection of movies is lacking far behind the competition, you need to up your game or you will keep losing subscribers. And no, it's not just about ""password sharing""."
I LOVED it until you couldn't share your password. That new little thing is useless you can just watch it on your phone or cast it from your phone to the TV and it will work.
"In my opinion, Netflix is a pretty good app. A reason why Netflix is a three-star is because one time, it fooled my daughter because it said that they would delete Naruto, her favorite show, on October 31. After that, she was really sad. Another reason why is because 4+ months after it fooled her, they actually deleted Naruto. Now she is VERY disappointed. Netflix, please get the license for Naruto back! Thank you if you read this, developers!"
My downloads always disappears. I downloaded the full season if castle and castle only for it to disappear after few hours. Even twin murder too. Very frustrating
I love Netflix but ever since the last update the app doesn't resume where i stopped... it resumes at different previous episodes. Please fix!
"Well the new update has bugs. I'm tring to get signed in and it won't even let me in to the app,even after restarting and uninstalling and reinstalling the app still won't let me in."
Canadian Netflix is only okay. Usually when I search for a title they don't have it and US Netflix is blocked. I'd like to see Canada and the US a single territory.
"Having problems lately with renew. Can't renew downloaded content. Have to delete and re-dowload from scratch. Please, make this work again."
the biggest thing I can't stand with this app is the lack of a category option. not to mention the current setup is pretty clumsy and restrictive.
Nice app I haven't experienced much problem but mine is why is it that nowadays I can't watch offline like before?? Initially I used to download and watch at anytime but these days I have to buy bundles which is so inconveniencing. I uninstalled and reinstalled but the issue's still there. Am giving upüôç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"I wish the screen could rotate after fresh installed without signing in yet, i find the get started annoying, in my tablet first that pops up is the log in page but in my phone the get started is annoying i want to go to the sign in page as i open it"
"Everything was fine till Feb 20. But now I am not able to update the payment. As i am texting d otp, the earlier page comes repeatedly. I thought maybe some problem with my debit card . Enquired in bank. My card is working fine. Please help"
"I was up to episode 516 in one piece but the next chapter was ""egghead"" that had episodes up to 1089"
It was brilliant in the beginning(1st couple of years) fresh new content & regularly but now it's time is pretty much over. Doesn't change it's content have fresh new shows/movies regularly enough any more. It's also a little bit expensive.
"Contents are nice, but there are 2 things i suggest, in Us and in Philippines, the price of you're service is the same but the number of shows and movies are not the same, there are more shows and movies on Us compare to Philippines, and the 2nd thing i suggest is it would be more fun and enjoying if you put a controllable video quality, cause it sucks that my wifi is 100mbps while the vid only plays at 360p or 480p, ps:my phone is iphone 8, tnx i hope you consider my suggestions"
"They will not make it easy to disable autoplay, even when you finally disable it, you will have to select ""watch credits"" in order to ¬´enjoy¬ª your interrupted season finale."
"I like the app dont get me wrong, its just the fact that yhe sub titles keep popping up automatically and its very inconvenient that there's no option of turning them off permanently"
"There needs to be more selection. Too many occult thems. We need better movies! I spend most of my viewing on Hulu, the movies and series are waly better. Im waiting to see if Netflix obtains better stuff."
"I absolutely love netflix, but there are so many bugs, for example it would say I am not connected or it wouldnt put my stuff on download, saying its full, even tho its empty anf so on, I really hope you guys would fix all of that"
"I like netflix as it is a great site for watching tv shows and movies. I only gave it three stars as shrek has been removed. Shrek is the best movie of all, and i dont aappreciate the fact that it is no longer on netflix."
It dosent catch up to date with the actual shows and it makes me feel sad when shows end and i dont get to watch the next season.Like is jjba it ended but didint show golden wind. But over all its a great app
There's shows and they are good quality but I've looked for 100 different shows that I thought would be cool to watch and they weren't available on Netflix. That's quite disappointing
"It's good, I only have a problem with the app when it doesn't want to work and I have to uninstall it and delete all my downloaded movies and series.ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
it's unfair to view movies list only after subscription..Like other apps user should be able to see movies list then he ll be able to decide to subscribe or not.
"It doesn't have much anime collection and some movies too. Whenever I find an interesting anime and i want to watch it, it is not there and same with movies. Would have given it more than 3 stars but for now it's 3. Please bring some more animes."
"I don't know why screen is going blank only audio is audibale ,it's repitative from past few days!! Work on it Netflix !!"
Really need an option to change subtitle color or add outline to the subtitle. The plain white subtitle is very unreadable in most of the scenes I'm watching.
"Can I revert to the last version somehow? It updated yesterday and now I can only watch in landscape mode, so no watching while docked or in my go-to, ""Netflix binge in bed"", position."
"Nice app, But my samsung android tablet begins each episode at same spot. If I skip ahead, when it starts next episode reverts back to the same starting point. Practically useless."
"Everytime the app asks to choose a profile. every single time when I open up the app, it asks ""who's watching?"". Netflix should fix this problem ASAP!"
"Netflix is great. But I don't like the new change. If I click info button on the app, then I want to go to the trailer. Put it back the way it use to be. Thank you"
Overall app is good but can not make any filter ehile searching something.criteria in for search Is vwry limited or with minimum options For example if you need to search Korean drama then you have select asian drama. In case you are searching for hindi dubbed then only option is in language select as hindi.
Recent update looks like a glitch.. Video stops in between and ain't play further.. I have to close the app and launch again.. Then it works.. Fix the issue..
"With the New update if it pauses it doesn't resume until get all the way out and back in. Usually no problem but this time yes. And the brightness sucks, if I can control it on my phone why on the app?"
Are we ever going to get to choose the video quality scales 360p-1080p from within the app? Also would be nice to have explore tab of shows and movies ‚ò∫Ô∏è app is all about murders
"I'm rating 3 star because I really want to watch... sailor moon R, andi mack, the yellow dog, Lion king (not new I wish to watch the old one.), lion king 2, and the MOVIE spirit. I really want to watch these shows and movies on netflix but I can't seem to find them on netflix (I mean KIDS netflix.), so could you maybe think about putting the shows and MOVIE on then I would give you a 5 star rating. and when you do think about it can you get back to me as responding to this rating and message."
I've uninstalled this app because it charging more than the supposed monthly due. I've tried reaching out to them and inquire about this. But they just said that in their system they only got the amount due.
"Please send a mail before next month subscription so if I want to change plan or something, I will be able to do it. This is the worst thing. I wanted to change my plan for my next month and then suddenly I wake up one day getting a message amount is debited from account. Please send a mail a day for renewal or subscription end."
"Works well, but: No playback speed control option. Asks to select profile on every startup. Opens itself randomly sometimes."
"Works fine. I appreciate no commercials, but disappearing seasons, shows, and movies kind of puts me off... App works fine, though"
"The app is great, but recently when I watch a movie, it error. I can hear the audio but the scene freeze"
"Can you fix the subtitle issue please. Can you atleast have the subtitles written on a black outline, its so hard to read when the subs are all while the the scene is also white."
"Shows are great everything pretty much is good. But the movies no, they rewrite the content to there own making not how the movies produced them or how they where released."
"Good quality, however, the brightness controls are annoying and far too dim for a mobile device. Brighten it up Netflix."
It's great to watch movies and many more on your phone. It will be great for the Netflix users to request the movie(s) or series that they want to watch on Netflix for exsmple HARRY POTTER
"I see netflix had to juump on the bandwagon wirh putting the prices up,not just by a little bit either.its nowhere close to worth the money now.now and again they will add one decent movie followed by loads of bad ones.i hope their greed will get to them soon.alot of people i know have already cancelled their subscriptions.its simply not worth the kind of money they want now.i suppose russia qill get the blame for that too.there are so many other decent movie apps around now with better content."
I give it a 3 because some of the shows or series u might like they only have one season and you've been waiting for a year or two for it to put the other seasons and some of the series that I like only have two which are random like season 3 and 6 of one of them which is annoying to me.
Quality of audio and video is great. I wish I could opt out of seeing videos with audio dubbing.
"Everytime I update my phone, the app stops opening. It shows errors. I have to reinstall the app again and download all my episodes AGAIN. PLZ FIX"
dear team..please have an option to mark stuff as watched...so that we get to see new tiles when we log in...its very irritating to browse throught the stuff again and again that one has watched in search of new stuff...hope you incorporate this soon..many of us want this feature....
Netflix use to have picture in picture the setting was removed please bring it back!!! it was very helpful whole I'm working from home on my phone I was still able to keep up with my shows
Netflix needs to due updates on their series shows....some shows are on season 7 while we are watching season 3....this is the only problem I have other then that great app!
works great but won't let me change the storage location to SD card on Samsung Galaxy Tab S9(SM-X916B). The issue is not isolated to just me. I'm on Android 13 with One UI 5.1.1
"The color scheme or callibration suddenly went really bad, the fps too, its started dropping a lot while playingt he videos (stuttering alot) im using mi 10 T currently and its completely fine on my mi A1, pls help solve this problem"
"Would be really awesome if you could have a Playlist or add to queue, so after one movie/series has finished the next in line can play. Pretty much like YouTube, Would so much better."
I am unable to watch it with my Android device as it keeps giving error -1023 and I can't do anything about it. But it's streaming fine in my laptop.
I'm not able to get rid of playback options while playing videos. I've to waid till it automatically goes off by itself. Please fix it soon
everything thing is good but there should be something called a setting the video quality but mine goes to lower quality evertime I see so Netflix give video settings every time we see something
"Netflix is very awsome, i had a date a few weeks back and the girl i when out with wanted to watch stranger things due to the new season being out. We ended upgoing back to my place where we proceeded to netflix n chill next thing i know im getting head to master of puppets very cool indeed."
Movies and shows are good but why is the app so glitchy. Dialogues run faster all of sudden than the character can't forward whats happening.
My playback is just crazy I am watching my show like trailer park boys or breaking bad and it just lags but I did your internet test and it said no latency I don't know if you could fix this otherwise it's still a great app
"I love it the only problem is that every time netfilx adds a show they don,t put all the seasons of the show like henry danger the thunder mans and danger force there are 5 seasons of henry danger but only 3 on netflix and there are 2 seasons of danger force but only one on netflix and there are 4 seasons of the thundermans but only 2 on netflix and if they fix it i will change my rating from 3 to 5 ok and can you guys please put ninjago crystalized on netflix"
"I have been watching Netflix on OnePlus 8 pro and for some reasons,the display is not full screen. i have a really big black bar right where the the punch hole is. Can you please solve this ?"
"When I had it it was good but that was YEARS ago! Dish had given us a free 1 yr paid subscription to Netflix. The last time we renewed we asked for the same but no. So our contract is almost up with Dish. We will probably say by, by."
This app of good but i have some error in my screen means when i start movies or series the videos os on but the screen is blank.
"Netflix It's okay kinda expensive for what it is. And they don't update new shows often enough and most of it is old movies from year 2,000's pretty much."
it is getting annoying lately. Occasionally gets device failure for no reason and all my downloaded movies unable to be played. need to re-download again.
"It's really annoying to find movies part 2, but not the part 1. Also, some series does not have previous seasons. Reing for example begins in season 4."
I am agreeing with many of the post here. I have been having problem with streaming netflix within this week. The app is not responding
Something very terrible with Netflix nowadays.. audio & video doesn't match.. automatically taking pauses after every few seconds... Guess need to uninstall now...
"Quality of indian movies chosen is not that great. Lot of cliche old fashioned karan johar movies, realized that the biggest influencer malayalam film of this year-""the great indian kitchen"" was rejected and we had to switch to a new platform to watch it. Makes the review process of neflix india questionable.. Have to admit there were some good malayalam/offbeat hindi movies.."
"I just downloaded the app. However, when I tried to open it, there was an error. It said that it cannot connect to the Netflix Server. So I'm just wandering what should I do. Thank you so much. Keep safe"
should upload more often movies and tv series because it seems stupid to pay almost 10¬£ for the old shows and movies.Will see how this month goes if it still remains the same im deleting the account also when i made it it said i get a free month trial on it but somehow ive been charged right away.
"I can't download it. It just keeps Pending. On 4G, on WiFi, at an Internet Cafe.... I even reset my phone... I pay monthly for this, yet I have to use my phone browser to watch videos.... Thanks Netflix"
Bug Freezes the programme or movie when using +10 or - 10 seconds. Music continues playing. otherwise a fantastic app.
The rating method of this site I don't like at all the whole thumbs up thumbs up more is so wrong and so many ways. you need to put one through five or one through 10 on the rating that way it's more accurate and makes more sense!!
It keeps bufferimg alot and my wifi ain't at fault the problem is that the audio and scenes aren't coordinating and it's really irritating.. You Gotta fix it soon
"For me, it's great because with just a subscription you can watch unlimited movies and TV shows but I wish that the prices could be a bit cheaper."
My netflix app just freezes at the first logo and doesnot go ahead beyond that point. I tried deleting data and reinstalling but still nothing. Just freezes at logo.
Bring back the play random episode option...it's one of the best to view sitcoms...and fix the bugs..I'm not able to add shows to the list
"i rated it 3 stars beacause it gliches out all the time, no its not my internet. i uninstall it once and awhile to see if that works but it never does. when ever it asks for me to update it i do and it never works/does anything. overall i still recommend it"
Would really like the screen while watching shows on the app to be brighter. It darkens to where I can't watch anything properly.
1. Missing some very good features which Amazon has... 2. Should be great to have a history of stuff I watched or markers to stress what I've watched
I cannot access netflix on my phone and can't even email them to ask why. I PAY ¬£13.99 a month for the devices I use and can't even use it on my phone.I did the update and nothing.Please fix this problem as its not fair on your subscribers who cant access netflix.thank you.
Love netflix. I would give 5 stars but I'm kind of disappointed when i couldn't find the series i wanted to watch after netflix is refreshed with new series. I hope archive can be provided for marked series that we want to watch later.
Netflix was perfect bet in recent updates it's not allowing me to watch videos on my phone but they work just fine on pc or smart tv. please fix this
It's very difficult to find content according to our required language. There should be an option which tells that which series is available in how many languages.
What have you done to the TV app??? The menu screen update is horrible!!! It was just fine how it was before. The service itself is excellent but this unnecessary change ruins it
Not happy that it's suddenly so dark no matter what I do on my androids. Fine on the TV and laptop. Phone or tablet...don't bother. It's a recent development and it SUCKS. Apparently they don't know how to fix it. :-(
"Every title says ""This title is not available to watch instantly"" on my Galaxy S8. Will change review if fixed. Update: uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Gave me a notice price was increasing to 13.99/ month. It works now."
Is there any way to present two language subtitle simultaneously? Could you add this feature please? It would be very useful for some language learning while watching the neflix shows. Thanks ahead.
"The app is working fine in every way..but my main concern is why netflix removing good movies..they removed mad max fury road, Spiderman far from home , mission impossible series and many more indian movies ..i took the membership just to watch the mission impossible series again.. but now its gone..that's not fair"
"Silly ""Instant Play"" is annoying while trying to browse shows. Programming is limited to most ""popular"", but not necessarily better movies..."
"Search do not work properly, on laptop I watch series which found by name xxxx for ex On mob when I enter the same name, it do not return me the same series Aggrrrrrr"
Adding black background to subtitles is really bad idea it was literally very good before now subs are really irritating and it just blocking half of the screen please change it to normal
After two years most of the movies of the same same with the shows Oculus VR is not full screen or 3D 10 seconds forward or back is not available which is very difficult in Oculus VR keep having to restart answers to the end of the Earth to get back to where you are...
"Its a pretty good app but i am an anime person, there is a few of them that i couldnt find like for an example dragon ball. I am a realy big fan of dragon ball, acually i got this app to wach it and found out they didnt have it. I'd love for y'all to add more animes."
only if you had an option which would automatically skip all nudity or sex scenes so I could watch the shows with my entire family.
Need more new content and should implement better quality of life things like a already watched tab where u can choose to surf the movies section and tv shows without seeing prevously watched shows appear.
The player is not that great. The visuals get stuck in between while the audio keeps playing in the background
"Netflix is great! But, there are'nt any marvel movies... The only marvel movie there is, is spider man far from home and I have already watched it 13 times so it is getting kinda boring:/ If you can, pls add more marvel movies thx:)))"
"Extremely difficult to watch most shows, especially those with darker lighting as they appear too dark even with full brightness."
"no matter what i watch, it skips frames. it'll be fine for about 5 minutes, then it'll do it until i touch the screen. ive looked up how to fix it and i can't find anything"
It's a nice app and it works really well but they keep getting rid of shows that people will actually watch for shows nobody wants to watch.
"App is good, there's alot to watch but I experienced a problem where the app stop responding and so I couldn't watch anything. Pls fix this if possible. I had to reinstall the app"
Netflix story lines way slow. DC and Warner Brothers do this much better. Except for Lost in space and the last 2 series of Startrek. Both excellent.
"App could not connect with the new update. It's not my internet connection. I've also restarted my phone several times.. What's up, Netflix? :("
Hate the fact that I can't find last watched or continue to view section immediately and I've to keep looking for it. Having v bad experience with this new UI
"My experience has been great.. That is, until my shows & movies started lagging. I've tried everything but nothing works."
"This has never happened before. Show plays for a couple of seconds but then stops. I've tried to update, play a different show... to no avail."
This app is good for shows and it uses less internet i love the app but why i put 3 stars is when you download a video and stay with a long time it expires non like YouTube but please was work on it but still this app is good keep up the good work keep up the good work.üòÅ
overall good app but it should allow password sharing
Well when I would be watching a show on my TV it would stop a a frame and we could not even turn the TV off I dont know if this is Netflix's problem or not but other than that its pretty good
"Will not load. Just keeps showing loading page. And even when I do manage to load it eventually, the videos won't work. Frustrating."
"Hi, I recommend you to add Demon Slayer Movie || Mugen Train . It was one of the movies that made alot of money in japan. And that means alot of people loved watching it. Maybe if you add it to your app, more people will join Netflix? What ever it is, just add it, it'll make your dream come true."
"Love netflix, but it crashes my phone and forces a restart about 2 out of every 3 uses, really wish they would fix this bug."
"How come 97% of upcoming recommended titles, just for me, are all in other languages I can't understand & I don't wanna have to read every movie? Other than that, if course I like Netflix. That's why I pay for it but...."
The genre search is horrible. Basically non existent. Why can I not just have the entire list of action movies instead of what your algorithm thinks I want to watch?
Honestly I would put a five but like its always flashing black and the movie and joking the screen all black I've tried to look it up and nother has helped so please fox this issue.
"Soooo many bugs with my Google home and casting! It freezes and then says it cant connect. Rebooter, reset, etc same issue. Fix! S8+"
"Been having too many problems with this app in the past week, it won't play most things for me, an error keeps coming up on my android phone and my iPad."
Recently unable to remove shows from My List - annoying. Can't remove Continue Watching shows no longer interested in. Can't log shows you've watched and see your reviews in one place.
There are many animes I want to watch but only available in Japanese. I love watching anime in English Dubbed version. Hope Netflix avails English Dubbed version of animes.
"For the moment, as an user of the app, i can't find list of already watched movies. And repeating of already watched movies is annoying."
"While it is acceptable it keeps saying that it can't playback and after trying all the fixes I end up having to uninstall and reinstall the app, yet again reinstall"
"I hate the lack of horror movies and please Netflix allow vpn because im paying the same price as everyone else and having less shows like in Japan they have more anime but paying the same and we need more episodes of baki , sex education , Saik K and more or just add the same anime or movies they have over there also we need more movies not Netflix originals actual top recent moviee then i would consider paying agian."
"Good, but the connection between the tablet and Chromecast isn't stable, to stop a show I need to open the Google Home app because the Netflix app does nothing"
"Why is the app overriding my device's brightness for specific shows? There is nothing to stop this in the app's settings and it only does it to certain shows. Why? Please let us disable this in the app, it's extremely frustrating."
I love almost everything about Netflix but some movies are not there
It takes alot of data...tooo much data....pls work on it...
It is expensive and the biggest minus point of this app is the collection of the web series is greater than the movies..... There should be more movies i think.
I cannot press the olqy button in the app. I can pause it! But if i click to unpause it doesnt work. I have to rewind or fast forward.
"subtitle border not showing, and other subtitle settings not working. maybe you can put the subtitle settings on the actual app not through the browser."
"Love that I can download movies and shows to watch when there's no internet connection. Seriously wish they'd quit taking off all the good shows, take years to upload new seasons of shows & keep raising the prices"
"The app is decent, but nothing special. It would be better if the app possessed the same level of account control and functionality as the desktop version."
Not happy with the new update you messed up the chromecast option and you keep taking your best shows down and putting up terrible netflix originals.
"Best when very little people are on it. When the whole COUNTRY'S on it, it is slow to load or it goes to 99% then waits for 30mins then says ""oops, something went wrong"""
Your recent update has bugs.. I can't play the recently downloaded videos.. it says some error 5.7... please correct it.. I've been using it for sometime.. this is the first time this has crashed..
Could be better when casting to tv. 30 second wait for next episode is very annoying. Also the play screen doesn't always work.
Netflix is very easy to cast to google chromecast but one problem. Most movies/TV shows play in mute although my volume and TV volume is at max pls fix
"I rate this app a 3/5 star rating because the app doesnt have to many interesting movies. The app has a lot of new movies that arnt even popular. Unless you enjoy rewatching very few movies and tv shows, this isn't worth the payment."
Not easy to add camera access
Hey Netflix just because the further in the future we go the more expensive stuff gets doesn't mean you should raise your prices also I remember a time when Netflix was only $8 a month and hard working Americans had shows on here that them and their families could be excited to see when they get home so plz for my sake and for the rest of the world take the price down some do it for the WORLD.
Ever since the update I Netflix does not work with picture in picture mode please fix this issue is very very annoying. Thank you
This app is good but sometimes it doesnt work and also subtitle of the movie comes at the top which is annoying. It should be at the bottom.
"Always asks me who is watching which is a bit annoying. Would like more sizes on the subtitles. Small is way to small on a 65"" 4k TV while the medium option is too big. Would love a dark yellow color as well."
"Getting harder for me to stay a customer with all these increases. Yea I know its cheaper then cable but their is also firestick (free), hulu (cheaper) amazon prime (5.99)."
Good app until 2 days ago. It shows Device Error. Please restart and other stuff and I have tried all the remedies it has given and after researching the remedies online but still the app doesnt work on my phone it is very frustrating
I having problems innupdating the app
Many great movies and all but way too many foreign unDubed movies. Think there are more Hindi movies and Japanese movies than anything else. Maybe balancing? Gets very borring watching and reading which makes it almost imposible to enjoy movies.
Love Netflix but have to give you a 3 because now the price is going up 3 dollars!! That's a really big increase I hope it's worth it. I give you 3 to 6 months before i cancel.
Netflixs quality has really decreased over the years. Got rid of most of my favorite shoes & replaced them with netflix originals. Prices have gone up also.
Add custom Subtitles! I am a persian and i want to watch movies with persian subtitles but its not available in the app. There must be a permission to add your own subtitles to movies
It's very comfortable using the app. However! THERES SOMETHING I REALLY HATE ABOUT NETFLIX LIKE EVEN THO EVERYONE AROUND THE WORLD IS PAYING THE SAME PRICE EACH MONTH WE'RE GETTING DIFFERENT CONTENT WHICH IS VERY UNFAIR!!!! I KNOW THAT THERE IS A VERY COMPLICATED REASON FOR THAT!! BUT STILL!! ITS UNFAIR!!
"Well.. the app was living up to it's expectations untill now. I've being trying to download movies it doesn't download,the cover of the movies don't even. Looks like the app is down or so...I don't know. Pls fix this!!"
Half the movies suck and aren't worth the money. Netflix also either doesn't have a movie till 2 years after it comes out (if that) and it always takes out good movies just because only some people watch them.
"I love netflix but have watched almost every show... i hate the fact that the US gets more shows because i'm sick of watchingbthe same shows over, i think that we should all get the same amount of shows."
"Its been 2 days i am unable to open Netflix on my android phone.i hv reinstalled the app, still it doesnt open. It only keeps showing netflix on its 1st page and page does nt changes. IS there anybody to help on this issue?"
Netflix consistently tries to take money off my card even though I cancel my account. That's STEALING.
"Good service, just plain cheap content. every movie with some succees in the past 5 years , you wont find it here. only marvel. tv shows are great though."
It would be helpful if there were categories for language. Half the shows I try to watch aren't in English. It would save sime time.
"Can't watch episodes without manually searching. Sometimes, I can't remind back or forward instead if I try to slide the slider it just goes to the next episode"
Netflix is good but...it always crashes and I watched most of the shows. I would love to have all the newest shows on there.
Glad you've let us choose not to have things auto playing (finally). Now just need nothing to pop up during the credits. And shows to mot start playing until after I've finished reading the description and actually chosen to press play.
i love it but lately its been closing before i can open it. ive tried to uninstall and install it. it doesn't work. i need this to be fix. I would rate higher.
"It was going good and i loved it. but after the latest upgrade, i am unable to download any content on my mobile! As i travel a lot, it's a must for me... pls rectify it asap or remove the upgrade!!!"
"App is not working, it is showing the error every time even though i have already tried each and every thing from my side, please help! I have paid for it but unable to worth it, i have redmi note 9"
"their is not thousands of movies and tv episodes to choose from. so advertising that there is, is entirely false and inaccurate to say the least."
Everytime i try to open up netflix it does not work and i cant even start free trial they keep deleting my account so when i try to pay it does not work please fix glitch.
Netflix is a okay app not to many problems but most of the shows just leave you on a cliff habger and its a bit annoying have to wait for the next season to come out if it ever does but it beats funimation because in funimation its 12+ adds and you have to have premium to wacth past episode 16 so overall its a okay app just please finish some of the animes and tv shows that are left off on cliffhangers and maybe finish naruto
I wish you would have Stargate Atlantis and all of the power rangers shows do this and I give it a 5 stars. I'm going to take a star away every month until you add these in. Add a request box for movies I'm not the only one who has some movies they like to see
"It starts playing a show even if you haven't actually pressed play. I want to be able to read the description in full, not have the show start as I'm reading what it's about."
Alright so my videos haven't been loading in properly they come out all pixelated and frozen while the video plays and then it just keeps signing me out all the time and it's just annoying
Since the last update when I'm watching Netflix on my phone shows I watch go back to the start of the episode even though last time was was half way through it and can't skip forward
"The stupid autoplaying trailers keep playing on my phone while I'm casting to the TV. And every category just shows me the same 20 movies I've already seen. Your algorithm sucks, have to go to a different profile to see other movies"
It is very expensive with plans and quality is very poor according to internet. Secondly you did not able to delete or edit your 'My List'.It should easy to use..
its okay but the things i dont like is the time i have to wait for my show to start sometimes... they also delelted bobs burgers like what the heck?! but im glad we have Netflix because its something to like watch if your show isnt on tv anymore... but ya i think a 3 is good
Netflix is great but some movies are not available on the indian Netflix. This is very unfortunate. Like few months ago the movie accountant was available on Netflix india. But now it has been removed. Why???
I like the server and stuff even if my internet is not strong enough the video still keeps on going What i hate though is the series when i watch anime half of the series is english and half of it is japanese in japanese the subtitles arent even correct so please fix this
"..better with multiple thumbs-up options..ideally, give us a 10-scale choice, as some movies are 4 or 5 & some are 8 to 9..10 would be the 1st Matrix, imho.."
I would like to address an issue I am having with my dads Netflix as it is not letting us load up Netflix on our mobile phones it does not even load the menu it has only started in the last 2 days so I would like you to maybe try and look in to it please
Netflix dismiss series while they are running more than one episode. It makes difficult to stop or pause and then play again from that spot
Doesn't have landscape orientation for the video list/main UI. Would be nice to plug my phone to the tv and have the menus in landscape.
"Overall decent streaming app, BUT NETFLIX DOES NOT NEED TO CONTROL NY PHONE BRIGHTNESS, ITS BASICALLY UNWATCHABLE AT NIGHT OR IN A DARK ROOM. YOUR SCREEN AT LOWEST BRIGHTNESS ON NETFLIX IS ABOUT HALF BRIGHTNESS ANYWHERE ELSE AND THERES NO WAY TO CHANGE IT."
Hangs evertime I switch between apps! Why???
"Overall the apps is OK, it could use more new movies and shows sooner instead of waiting for a few years or not even be able to getit on the app"
"good app but just today i found a bug on the app, whenever i try watchign a movie, series or tv show on general, to skips 10 seconds or goes back 10 seconds (dependong on my screen orientation)"
"there are some movies that i used to watch on netflix such as thor ragnarok and baywatch,but now they didn't have it anymore. While i have to pay more but some of the movies that i used to watch on netflix is not in netflix anymore.. it's lack of choices"
So I was kinda disappointed to notice that more movies and shows were removed I still like Netflix I think it's great I just wish they'd stop taking away all the good shows and movies and then replace them with others that can't even compete
"Netflix, please please please for the love of humanity add ratings n reviews for shows in the app. it's high time now that you need to do this. Add that for one star and then add better movies and shows for 5 star."
"It's VERY GOOD... but, I noticed that the VIDEO QUALITY is slightly lacking. >> (even with the brightness ALL THE WAY UP) ""on my Samsung Galaxy Note 9"", the screen looks DARKER than I'd like & NOT as clear as it should be. (ONLY on this app.)"
"When in background, Netflix automatically resumes the playback when another media finishes playing, and that is annoying as hell."
"Something wrong with the recent update. I realized when I watch my ""downloads"" video it still consume my data. What the hell is going on? Netflix pls fix this."
"Recently discovered can't screen cast shows, which means I can't use it on my backyard projector... Why?? üòí Just another example of how streaming services are really going downhill"
You put in a feature that makes you go back to the begining after i look at something to see if i want to watch it. That is very annoying. I wish you would remove it. Thats why i dont watch youtube.
Netflix is the best but with a recent update the subtitles comes on automatically and u have to turn it off every time.
The shows are really good. But the problem is that I can't log into my MI phone. Once I tell my password it will take a long time for loading but will never show up. Same problem with my friend. Please resolve it.
Me and my sister were watching season 3 of Miraculous ladybug but we want to watch season 4 but can't otherwise we would have to switch to Disney+ and we already struggle to pay for Netflix so please even tho we live in RSA can't we also watch our favorite shows
"It's not letting me complete my sign up, I've put in all my credit card info and a goldish colored box pops up at the top of the screen and say, sorry cannot complete sign up, please try again later and ice tried 3 times already."
The app is the best entertainment in the world. But today it's crashing and freezing often. Please send an update to get it working fine.
"I love Netflix. I would give 5 stars, but why did you take away the ""Are you still watching"" PLEASE bring it back. After it went away there was a sleep timer. Now that is gone too. PLEASE bring back the SLEEP TIMER or ARE YOU STILL WATCHING!!!!!"
It's a good place to watch shows and movies but there's usually a fifty fifty chance of it showing stuff like certain movies but not having exactly what you're looking for. I give it a 7/10
I really like this app however I was in the middle of an episode and it had randomly stopped so I thought I'd restart the app and the app won't even load now. Please fix the issue.
Netflix.......Why autopay darling......I will pay when I love it.......
"PUT BACK RED VS. BLUE! IT'S THE BEST ONE!! üò° Also I don't spend to much time on netflix bc they removed a popular series call ""Red vs. Blue"", so put it back plz."
Its great except that i accidentally put it in fullscreen and there's no button and the zoom doesn't work with to get it back to the right way up.
Cut the cord awhile ago & have used Netflix extensively lately. Too bad I have run through the majority of movies and find little to watch.
I can't share some of the Netflix posters to Instagram. Once I clicked share it'll automatically appears on my Instagram Stories but with a very blur Netflix poster. Can you fix this?
Almost once in a month i face some server issue like -1009 and it doesnt open and automatically it log outs...so i gotta switch off and unistall and install the app and everything i gotta do ...such a devastating experience
"Alot of movies are being removed from my list like Groundhog day plus US version have better tv shows than KSA version Like Charmed and Supernatural and more, the best old TV Show available in KSA is Friends..they brought it later as it was also in the US VERSION and not in the KSA version."
Is there something wrong with netflix? Its been 2 days. When i pause a movie and try to play it again it just keeps on doing that red circle that its loading. Can you please look into it. Thank u
I like Netflix don't get me wrong but the way they run things don't make since. Well like let's say everyone likes a show or it is very popular it doesnt matter they will take it off to make room for more shows. And lots of those shows suck like the hype house. No one cares that you like to make tiktoks together.
"Normally ok, decent content. Recently casting from a.google phone has been a nightmare have had to delete and reinstall the app multiple times a day."
"Why ? other streaming apps like Amazon prime video and Disney+ hotstar has options for having many accounts , but in Netflix we cannot have why. But in Netflix we can watch many movies,drams,documentaries,animes,....etc every thing"
"What's with all the lame games? I go to this to watch shows, not to play games."
Netflix is great but the slightest problem is that most of the good shows/movies have been removed and added after a while but other than that it's a great app
"Love Netflix who doesn't! However, I will give 5 stars when you can mark movies I have watched and stop showing them on my profile ! When I am looking for new movies in Drama, Comedies etc all the movies I have watched still appear."
Netflix is good but not that satisfying because you can't find the movie you're looking for. I'd like to do marathon with Marvels but there is no Iron Man 2.
I like having Netflix but the thing that bugs me the most is that they don't have my hero academia which is one of my favorite shows if the makers of Netflix could please put my hero academia on Netflix I would be really happy
"the app have been crack/hang/error/shut down most of the time when I open. I try to see they might on the updated process, but not. I pay for premium one. So bad feeling now."
I love netflix and all of its anime but recently the anime will stop on random points every few secounds. I know its not just the anime im watching because it happens on everything i watch. Im not sure if this happens for other shows outside of anim but please fix it! :(
"Icant open now , showing some error, I restart my phone, re-installed the app but still showing the same error ""we could not reach the Netflix sevice""."
"The app is working great. The problem started with the latest payment not being revised, even trying many times the problem still persists."
"Why can't the canadian netflix cater to more interesting shows and movies lile in the US or UK. More variety please. Otherwise, i gave up my cable tv since this option is available."
"Some free offers but they want to much $$$ for old TV shows that you can find for free Offer some free old TV shows.. Tubi has lots of fun old TV shows FREE , and Netflix would like you to buy it as they think you are buying the video pack.. Money will be your down fall. You think we are stupid.?? We leave. Grade C"
I would've actually used it if the Price(s) were reasonable.. Also I think Netflix should have a sale like 30% on standard sub. as it would actually help people stayin' Indoors
Generally a great app. But why do I loose my downloaded movies and series whenever I update. I won't see my downloads again and the storage space still indicates full.. Please do something about it
"The app is good by the play motion of the app slows down as I am using wifi which shouldnt have any problems.The framerate is very slow ,kindly look into this matter and fix the bug asap"
"It is a good app there's a lot of shows but what I dislike the most is that some series does not have the 1st season but has the 2nd and so on. Which is dumb, because how am I gonna start a series without the 1st season."
Keeps on getting stopped when app is open Netflix logo appears and no further steps I deleted cleared cache did everything each and everytime I hve to to uninstall and install it... Hope this would b resolved
I am unable watch show in HDR on my one plus 7t device even though it supports HDR10+. I can't uninstall the app and I have tried everything from the help center . What is wrong
"Unsure what happened with the last update, but the picture quality is now terrible! It's so bad I can't actually make out the faces of the actors I'm watching. Please fix, I love this app."
"Not gonna lie, with all of the price increases, it's making it harder to stay on board... Also, can you please do away with the automatic previews!!!!"
"They raise the price every year and there's nothing worth watching on Netflix anymore!! Don't bother... add another tv app and you won't even miss this!! Plus they support pedophiles now too!! Its not worth 10 bucks a month, much less 14!! ü§£üëéüèºü§öüèΩ"
"It's very bad that many videos have only Hindi audio but no other major regional languages which is disappointing, heard recently they added tamil dubbed for squid game but i couldn't see the option at all."
Good but it should have swipe up and down on right side of device to adjust volume. You can adjust the left for brightness so why not volume?
"Finding movies can get difficult, but on the other note some of the top picks are fairly good. Not big on the sub title movies but hey lol some of them are pretty good!"
App works decent enough but i am unable to use it on my GoogleTV due to having other people in the house who also have their own netflix accounts and the app only works with the 1 account that is signed in.
It's ok but won't cast to Google Tv with Chromecast built in. Every other app can cast to the tv but not Netflix. Mar 30 - cast working once again.
Why tha heck is a black background on my subtitles. I did everything I can do in the settings still nothing happened . Please fix this and make subtitles transparent again
Not happy about the increase in cost for each package to choose from and would like it if netflix had a rewards program like how speedway gas station has.
"After the update, when you press home and you have the picture to picture mode, you cannot press it to make it to the big video player or pause or play it except using headphone's remote"
"I used to be able to access the download history feature. When I go into Account, there is no longer Parental Controls option."
I have s7 edge and the device is capable of running HD but Netflix doesn't allow for HD steaming.. Please change that and it will be 5 stars
Netflix as a service is fabulous but the app frequently logs me out right in the middle of watching. Hope they fix this soon.
I have the LG G8 with Oled screen and this app is so bland when I'm trying to watch content every show seems like colors are faded making my experience not good at all. Everything works but watching content is bland.
"Love the option of advertising and enjoy the convenience. Use on my t.v not had problem, like other's have had.."
"It was ok, but it won't let me update it so I can't play triviaverse or trivia games in General. Otherwise it's fine I would recommend it."
"Overall, just OK! When you are paying for a service, and your service is Entertainment, more precisely movies and shows, you should be able to view literally ANY movie or show regardless of production year or company. Crush the competition and make this happen, Please!!!"
"I dont know if it should be working like that but While watching certain film on Netflix which is divided into seasons, which I am not able to switch between on android tablet if u could help with that thank you"
I like it but I need an English dub for all seasons in demon slayer
It keeps logging me out and then saying password incorrect even if i change the account I'm using. Other than that i love the shows on Netflix and its the only reason I'm updating nowü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
It's not bad but I wish the app it self you can change the subtitle cause imagine watching a series and cant understand because it's a white subtitle and the login issue that's a next ball park gotta give up soon
Bad UX for me. The side scrolling is annoying. I should be able to click and see everything underneath it.
"Netflix team, please make themes in it, the black background is so irritating. Already your shows are negative almost. Add more comedy shows. We love funny (veg comedy) . And please I want White theme. I love light. I hate darkness. It feels bohara at night to open the app. üôÑ"
There's some bugs like when you have something that you been watching it will not be in continue watching and sometimes it's glitchy but other then that there is plany of things to watch.!!!
"Would love to know why we all buy huge screen tvs when every film only covers half the screen please give me a reason why there have been so many movie , series TV shows all taking up half the screen whats the point in having a 75inch to still be watching a 32 inch film !!!!!!!!!"
When watching a good movie with family it becomes embarrassing if a sensitive or sensual scene comes in.... Please add a fast forward button while playing a show or movie... Or give parental advice warning before a sensitive or sensual moment in the movie so one does not have to forward all the good scenes after a bold scene.
It is a good app but it has gliches sometimes but it lets you watch all your favorite shows and sometimes the get rid of old shows you used to watch and adds new ones
good but hard to read the subtitles especially watching animes. unlike when you are watching on TV. need to add a dark shadow to subtitles so we can read the subs just like on TV
"Fir the last few days, there's a problem with the downloading. If more than one video is downloading, it shows the download is full. Please fix the issue"
"I discovered many of the movies were older movies I had seen years before Others were already played on tv. I found maybe four updated movies. While my membership for free trial lasted only five days because I added card. I believe updating movies, maybe already in theaters."
"I'm considering to look elsewhere, Netflix audio constantly goes off on my smart Samsung smart TV. Sure is not an android TV but that does that mean the Netflix app should perform worse?"
Full of bugs: it doesn't register right when you finish an episode or a series. It is always a confusion.
From past 2 days i have noticed that the vedios are not loading. Its not my internet and definitely nothing wrong with my phone. Netflix dev team please fix the issue.
"I had a issue after my device moto edge 20 fusion is updated in Android 12, Netflix shows device playback specification is SD, i really tired even after that there are so many updates are gone still its SD plzzz solved it."
"How are you going to raise the prices.. not by cents or even a dollar..but dollars, and not have anime's with more sub/dub language options, no new movies.. just taking off the good series you already had... Everytime they raise the price, the app seems to get shittier."
It's all languages cuz there's one stroke a disastrous life of saiki K so can you add an English to that show that's finally getting this a free want to die rating please please get English version that one season 2 not like season 1 and season free I'm not like season 1 season 1 English dubbed English version and I re-watch all And then 5 stars
"Unfortunately, the quality of the sound as a Dolby Surround or Dolby Atmos for 90% of the movies are not good at all.. any one who has an experience with hometheater will recognise this issue immediately. I'm not happy at all because of it."
"Love the app but facing issues while downloading the movies using mobile data hope you can fix it, happens after i pause and then resume the downloads."
I'm facing issue with app update. There is 2.9 MB update that is continuously poping up every second even after being update. Can u please fix this issue. Otherwise overalls performance is good.
Good app. But why does it say cant connect to network very often? I need to uninstall it and reinstall before it works. Its obviously not my internet because I watch Youtube a lot with no problems.
I use a Chromebook with this app and every once in a while it lag s and doesn't open but overall the experience is great otherwise.
It's a good app but to download it takes up space. Right now I have NO INTERNET AT ALLLLLL and I wanted to watch my downloads. It says I have to update the app. I don't have any space or Internet or anything to do now.
"I'll give you 5 start when there's gonna be a wider variety of shows in Romania. Right now the amount of good ones is really low, and there are lost of well-known movies and series available in other countries that we would like to have access to."
Great App! Quite a well developed one. Interesting & Reliable. I however challenge you to unlock more content. I personally recommend it.
Every month it crashes.. why it keeps on crashing. this is the only app i pay and keep on crashing... always doing uninstall and install everytime it crashed
"Implemented games to add some nice & fun experiences, but only ended up in frustration from buggy apps."
It's ok but frustrating at the same time. I can't find a lot of movie that are already on air. Empire is a movie which I subscribed for premium but yet I can't find it on Netflix
Netflix is Great! But I put a 3 star because netflix should add an option to change the subtitle color and font and make the colors changing
The app was okay before but now it takes too long to load even though I uninstalled it and then reinstalled it. It also doesn't work when I try to close the app and open it again. Please fix this issue it would be highly appreciated.
"the app keep crashing, keep saying restart and keep on unable to connect to server. all those downloaded movie been deleted. pls fix it!"
"I finished the whole payment inorder to start membership but I get dissapointed when I get this kind of message ""there's appears to be a problem with the payment method you are trying to use "" while I got confirmed the payment was successful. Why is that? Please fix this or kindly refund my payment"
It's so great‚ù§Ô∏èüòäüòç but why do I not see the kissing booth especially the second one it just came on there and you didn't take other stuff off that been on there forever üò†üò°üò§ please put them both back on PLZ!!!!!! And that goes for many more movies.
"Unfortunately the app will not work at all, ie error message appears, following the latest Andoid Pie update issued this week ... very poor for a paid service. Otherwise the app, when working, is pretty good."
New problem has arrived after the latest update. Everytime when i open the app it shows error and tells to relaunch the app. And i am also not able to download episodes
"Please provide the language on the bio of the movie before starting, so that we know easily the movie/series in which language. . The best place to show languages below the cast. . Rest everything is good in app to use."
fix the back arrow option. whenever I click it close the apps. I want to go to home page not close the apps and give option to turn off continue watching.
i absolutely loved this app for two years now but all the sudden for two days now it says it cant connect ti the server. ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but it still will not connect to the server
"I heard Netflix is about to raise their prices AGAIN due to these crybaby millionaire actors wanting to get paid more. I will tell you Netflix, if you so much as raise a penny more, I and many people more will drop you like a bad habit! There are many other movie streaming apps out there that ARE free to the viewers and you whoever you are reading this, better let someone know about the big mistake they are about to make as many have and LOST millions!"
Very bad experience. Sometimes i would not able to play any vedio on Netflix until i restart my mobile. Kindly chnge something in your app to avoid this type of issues.
the app is good....yesterday an incident happened with me...i've downloaded Some series and movies which was around 6GB data...and suddenly errror happened and boom...my all Downloaded data has gone in a second...woowww
"Netflix app not responding this is one of the reason i gave u 3 stars and the other one is I cannot even download one episode even though our subscription says that it is apolicable to more devices, PLEASE FIX THIS"
your getting rid of all my FAVORITE movies. what is there to watch anymore?? most of the movies are great but the ones that are getting removed are the reason I got Netflix in the first place.
It's ok but it doesn't always play right through it freezes and then you have to go out and come back into it especially if you have stopped and trying to watch it on your phone through your TV
Don't know what happened from last 2 updates during playing content on Netflix I can lock screen from Netflix options but after lock unable to unlock everytime need to turn off Netflix & restart...
There's a weird bug where I would go to another app while watching something and whenever I play media on that app Netflix audio will resume...
"Please add the 2x speed multiplier, it really helps when I am binge watching a lot of series. Hope Netflix will hear my concern and do something about it."
Please provide auto Skip Intro and outro..
Last time my payment got suspended for unknown reasons and I didn't even got my money back.That experience was totally awful. Though apart from this my experience was always good as viewer of Netflix.
App is fine but eats an insane amount of battery when using with Chromecast on my Note 8. Please fix! No other app drains battery app quickly when casting.
I try to subscribe this OTT platform. I don't understand that irritating. My subscription is not done on Netflix. Not move on next content page. Ones again content is show on Netflix. I give three star.
"Three stars for now because first of all my netflix is broken when i want to watch something, something will happen like when your cd is scratch and also the quality issues theres no button for that hope you fix this"
3 stars I've given for the content.... 2 stars I've cut down for the application. My cellphone hangs while playing a video and I have to restart my phone.
Dont like the latest 'feature' of having to select profile everytime that app is opened. Please revert to having a default profile unless switched on deliberately
Everything works except for the search function
Please stop removing popular movies and series that people like! I was so disappointed when The Office and Gossip Girl got taken away. It seems you keep adding documentaries and B movies. Not as happy as we used to be with Netflix.
"Earlier we could download as many offline videos as the space on our SD card provides! But now, it says there are too many downloaded videos and delete some to download new videos. How to resolve the issue?"
Everthing is really fine and good but If you pause the movie or mistakenly back it..it doesn't start again üôÑ Buffring for like hours sometimes I love Neflix but sometimes it kills the mood so hard that i almost broke my phone twice.. Almost.. Ok
"Its good on my phone. But when I watch it on my tv, it freezes. I Have to turn of my console. All the other apps work fine."
Your PC version doesn't pause a download or show download progress. And doesn't work audio when connected with HDMI cable to my TV.
The only thing I don't like is that they have millions of movies and some movies I would like to watch from the past and they should be available all movie should be available if they're older movies if their new movies I can understand the weight but if they're older you shouldn't have to wait you should be able to go in there and pick whatever you want and be able to watch what you want
Most of the movies are not available
Netflix please fix whatever is wrong with your app. I can't even find the download icon and I can't access my downloaded movies. Please fix it Dear Netflix please fix the app. I can't download any movies. Please please please fix it
Pay pal takes too long to set up so I think that you could improve this app by not including any pay until its been a month ( free month trial) then you can pause there account so they can't access it until they pay - this is just a suggestion
NETFLIX has a lots of contents and it's really clean. i love it. It may not not be the best but it's better than most of other streaming platforms present in market.
the movie is ok. the player is old one. can not adjust brightness and volume from its own display by gesture..
i like the app but i recently added my account on a new device and as i play downladed movies then leave without pausing it corrupts and refuses to play...... i have to keep deleting or uninstalling as i install several times to access then again. Please advice ‚òπÔ∏è
"I still love Netflix but I currently have a Moto edge 2022 and it will not support picture and picture on Netflix I have checked everywhere, the picture and picture is turned on under permissions and I'm getting very frustrated about this."
The app is good but not to keep year round I get it for a month and delete it for a month. Not enough new movies or shows. It's just the same stuff under every category
"App performs well but I hate the hard to reach exit button, far away from all the other controls."
"I THINK THIS IS A GREAT, SERVICE, BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A BRIGHTNESS CONTROL FOR ALL PHONES ON THERE APP TO CONTROL THE QUALITY OF PICTURES FOR OUTDOOR DAYLIGHT VIEWING.j Even with the new daylight bar it is still not bright enough for daylight viewing in your car, for instance"
"Okay except watching it on a smartphone. You can't adjust the brightness so when watching movies that are dark, you can't see what is going on"
"I hope we can change the color of subtitles, I love watching here but sometimes the color of subtitles are same as the show so it's impossible to read them."
"Okey so been Rlly enjoying it, no doubt NETFLIX is rising for years and yrs üëåüèª and Keep it up... BUT It needs more developement & additions guys... Ex: MODIFY our ""MyList"" aswell or make categories inside.. and how can we Modify Screen Qlty in case we want to (shd not b automatic) & maybe just maybe u can do polls or a way to know what r movies/Series ur clients want (Like a wishList?) then u wd know which products to add more later on.. just a suggestion, hope you read this. NETFLIX üôåüèª."
Please kindly put more movies . Collection of movies on netflix are very old please try putting new movies like amazon app has . We are paying big amount and very less movies available .
It is a nice app for downloading movies but when im not at home and trying to watch the downloaded videos it is not working and every time i reset my phone i have to either sigh in or log in again so im highly disappointed of this app
This is only a suggestion: at the very end of every episode/movie there should be a comment section for viewers to voice their opinions on the episode/movie they just watched (the comment section must only be accessible at the end of the episode to avoid spoilers.)
"Bad Connectivity .... There's no option to cast to TV, nor is Netflix supported by many smart TV devices - only 8 TV brands globally support Netflix."
Freezes up and kicks me out too often. Have to uninstall/reinstall or clear data way to often and I have a newer phone. Otherwise LOVE IT!
You should give us option to add a background shadow on the subtitle so that we can read it properly specially on the scenes with bright light.
"It always crashes when playing movies saying that there's a problem playing the video, so I have to restart my phone half the time."
"I LOVE Netflix however, the latest update is super annoying.... It takes so long to download and buffers so much. Makes me want to uninstall the update."
"For some reason, the app starts shuttering whenever there is some update like it forces us to update the app. It's annoying. Also, I do not understand why 'why we love the app for editor's choice' is in Japanese?!"
"You should add more faith and spirituality content and specifically heartfelt content. I loved a few, but there're just now enough. Im looking for christian content and it's hard to find because its included with the other religions."
"Convenient app. But it no longer stays on screen if i do anything else on my phone. Used to minimize and stay running, now it just closes."
I LOVEEE Netflix but lately it's been kicking me out from the app and it makes me really upset since I haven't been able to watch my favorite shows so if you could please fix this issue
Its a good app to watch movies on but Netflix Singapore(Compared to Netflix US) doesn't have many of the shows which i originally got netflix to watch e.g. miraculous or twilight even though google says it does.
"Always asks who's watching when it used to know automatically, glitches out when i cast it... Screen goes glitchy/set to cast but doesn't cast, crashes when I'm on the ""Coming soon"" tab."
"Previously, before playing the video, you can check in which languages the movie is available but its updated version is not providing such information. I'm truly not liking this updated version."
Worked amazing with no problems up until a week or 2 ago. Now when I open the app its frozen on the loading screen.
Certain shows won't add to my list. I'm not using a geo unblocker or anything just using it the way an average user would.
Every now and then the video freezes while the audio keeps playing making the whole thing out of sync and it is very annoying
It's okay honestly I don't know why I'm still paying for it Disney plus was a bust I use Cinema HD it's free & has everything Disney plus has everything Netflix has hulu etc etc. I am deleting all my subscriptions since I don't have to pay for anything y'all should too dont pay the man that bastards rich already....
I downloaded seasons and some movies and when I checked downloads after sometime they weren't there. So i downloaded again and happened same like before. Fix this problem.
App was great until a recent update and now downloads will not work or play on android device. There have been a couple updates since and still not working.
I am facing an issue whenever i try to use netflix it opens but videos doesn't plays so i have to restart my mobile and launch it again and same if i come out of the app login back it doesn't plays the videos so have to restart device i am using vivo s1 please resolve this issue
"I really like this app, except it has mainly alot of things people would rather not watch, dont get me wrong all my favourite movies are on here but like people want to see the sequel of a movie If its been out for a long time dont add number 1 and number 3 it just doesnt make sence all the time üëç"
Having issues with picture in picture mode. The display would go black but the audio would continue playing.
I'm recently facing an issue with Netflix in my phone. It keep on getting stuck whenever I pause and replay. Can you let me know why is it so and how can it be rectified?
I just joined the app good idea and everything i just got one question why the hell there are cut scenes in the movies i watch a movie that i love and there part that are been cut because they are not so important that's an art someone was doing it for the people don't touch the art please
I just dont get this...like why is that certain type of movie is only available in some countries like tf that dont make no sense it's still called Netflix so y is it that some countries get to watch movies on Netflix that am paying for as well n cannot watch i just dont get it
App is currently not loading on my phone. Just crashes everytime I launch it. First time I am experiencing this issue. Update 01.08.20: Reinstalling app resolved issue.
Stuck on 'would you like to watch on this tv?' I can't even tap on anything else and it doesn't work even when I force stop the app or try a different profile.
Its a pretty good app. I love watching all of my favorites but the sucky part is that Netflix is costing more and I don't like it. I get that they are trying to get more buyers but not a lot of people have that kind of money.
I had a very great experience until i couldn't get the season 3 of riverdale and it had been released since last year.I don't know if it is because of my location but i would really like to have a solution to my problem.
Pretty good. Hoping too find some old movies. I haven't seen for years!... It would be pretty good. Lately Netflix has been buffering and won't allow me to look at my list completely. It's doing my head in ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"Please, give us back the old update... This new isn't working well, I can't scroll all the page just to see all the content and watch nothing, cause I'm more bored searching for something. It even doesn't work now, the app always takes me out to my home:("
The screen pauses but the audio keeps playing. Even after uninstalling app it still the same issue. Please fix this bug
"Previous versions had less glitches, from lists overriding eithers on my download lists, to videos starting at a previous stage than when I left it etc."
Netflix sometimes takes forever to load. But its worth is because it has my two fave shows. I cant live without watching them.
"Its okay, you can watch films series and whatever u want but this update is terrible, like please fix it and when my internet is slow image freezes and sound is going like please fix it i hope u got great rateüíóüíóüíó."
Most of the movie's specially episode movie's are not completed
"Too Many OTT Too Much Price. Tell Us How Many OTTs we should subscribe to. And you are pricing subscription not less than 300 Rupee. There are 35 OTT, so we have to pay 10500 PM to subscribe to all of them. That's insane. Atleast keep price within the range of common man. Rs.25-40 should be the subscription charges. So everyone can afford everything."
"I like the movies but the tv show selections are garbage. It has the occasional great one but I am not interested in almost all of them. Was excited to watch Family Guy, Futurama, and American Dad but they aint got it no more. Might as well get hulu"
Crashing my phone. If I open the app there's a good chance my phone will restart then it'll open. Its honestly really annoying fix your app.
"There are a lot of movies that you have their names, but no actual movies in. Something like, ""daylight with Silvester Stallone, or all Step up"" and so many other good movies that I would want to see, but only the name of the movie there"
"More entertaining stuff wanted, it seems Netflix only wants to increase subscriber base. Same stuff being repeated and old movies being uploaded. Am sure they can do better."
this is an interesting app of movies
The best streaming app I have used so far with new contents every month. The only problem that I have is that it is too expensive for an individual person.
"the app is amazing ....but have one problem as the payment methods for subscription are only debit card or credit cards....as indians don't trust to give their card details online so. mostly indians don't use netflix...if it has another payment options like googlepay ,phonepay ,paytm or internet banking ...then definetly it would attract a lot of customers from indian communities....so I request netflix to add at least Gpay or paytm for payment services ......it would be beneficial to company to"
I love the app. My only complaint is that my Netflix HD is not available on my new Oneplus 8. This is very disappointing.
"It is good then but it suddenly don't work on my phoneüò≠ it said that I need to pay for an extra member, but dati naman walang binabayaran, sorry hindi kona kayang mag english üòÅ"
My suggestion is that you should add hindi language with all the content you upload in this platform... so that not only me but my family who only knows one language other than regional languages.. i.e. hindi should be able to understand and enjoy what you want to show us on your netflix platform. thank you
Lately it's been stuttering on my note 10+ I don't know why but it's becoming annoying. I tried everything I can think of. Before it use to work flawlessly.
Bad price and video player sucks
It was very awesome at the start and i loved watching alot but then they started removing some of my favorite shows and it really upset me so if they could put back some of the shows like four sisters and a wedding and some others then i would give a five star and they are kindo removing alot
"I've a shared account with three friends of mine, suddenly I'm not able to access to the account anymore, I put the correct password and everything, but it says that the password isn't correct."
"Its ok, just don't like that ut mixes different countries movies and tv shows... Different languages other than English should have their own section.... I like to watch movies and TV shows, NOT read them...."
App is okay. I just hope the selection of movies and series is good like before. Still waiting for The OA to have a 3rd Season but I guess Netflix won't give budget for it. It was a darn good show.
1 Netflix is too expensive. 2 the TV shows I like are not in English. 3 it consumed so much dada. 4 I cancel my account and before I new is back on again I'm the only person suppose to have access my account. Aside from that is ok I like it
Nice one. But the subscription is too expensive. Paying for subscription and also paying for wifi is becoming more expensive.
"After the updates, I can't watch any show with non kids ratings. My profile is set to have access for All Maturity yet I can't watch any shows with maturity setting 13+ and above or continue to watch my series. Please fix the problem. My kids have separate profiles and all the adult profiles are now have the same maturity settings as the kids' profiles eventhough it's stated that we have All Maturity setting."
Hi... I love Netflix without doubt.. My all my videos have only a blank screen with audio.. After the latest update.. Which is very disturbing
"No longer allowing casting? Not sure what happened with an update, or what's changed with my device, but I can no longer cast to my Chromecast or Roku devices"
"I did download the new update. The app does not work. It does not even login page. I will quit and go to Amazon Prime Video. I dont like their app much, but it works."
"Very bad update, we can not choose from different categories right now, therefore Limited movies or shows can be selected, if no fix, i might consider to quit."
I love tha app and the content !! But being a student is very hard to pay money for subscription every month .. As there are month were i only use the app for total of one to 2 weeks
The service is rathet pricey. Apps ok although it often has trouble connecting. That could be my internet service but i dont have the issue with any other app.
Some times hanging app opening time loading not play videos
It's still hard to find international movies and those that came out in the theaters but the selection of movies available are good.
You need a way to filter content by language(s). I just want english speaking shows and movies and not foreign language ones I must read to follow along. More english voice overs would be good.
Most of their movies are low budget. Most of their movies repeat in each catagory so it seems like they have more than they actually do.
I am a paid subscriber. Can i understand why there are certain movies or dramas which are only available on TV app but not on mobile app? It should be consistent content throughout all devices platforms that we can have an equitable enjoyable viewing experience. Agreed?
"Its good and all, but I am bored of it too. Netflix needs a fresh turn over rate. Maybe even add some way to vote for 10 new shows or movies every so often."
Earlier there was Cast option on app. But now we don't find that option. Can you please tell me what happened. Also you should have added video quality option while watching similar like other app. Otherwise app is fine.
Hubby just got a new phone Samsung s21 and for some reason can't find an app for Netflix. Can you please help as use every night on TV in bedroom through Chromecast but now can't find anything. Is there a new app?
"Don't have current movies Increased tariff, why?"
Does not have all six seasons of my hero academia
No doubt the app is fantastic but it doesn't open sometimes. I am unable to enter into it. It only shows the Netflix logo.
Definitely not as good as it used to be many year's ago
I can't even watch it anymore it ain't
Stop counting your money and fix your app ü§£
"I like Netflix but the thing is, I don't like that it takes out shows and movies like, Pokemon XYZ, Pokemon XY, and more movies and shows. I just want Netflix to not take out movies and shows"
"The app is fine but it's have some issues with casting. The ""next episode"" button is covered with other menu, it's looks like a ui bug."
Please provide Baki and dragon ball super All season in Hindi
It's nice to know what your updating. Is it a bug fix do you want to endorse ads do you want to go ahead and say hey let's make em have location services as well. Idk bout yall but us tech geeks like to know about that
I am not able to restart my membership.
I enjoy Netflix and they own shows I just don't like that they nva really update they shows oftern it take over a yr to update and it's always a few episodes they put i end up forgetting about the app after a while and pretty much ready to take it down I'm paying just to wait
It keeps glitching
It works properly on my pc but when it comes to my cellphone it shows Sorry we couldn't reach Netflix service ... 1001 error always ... It's really annoying.
Netflix is fun but there is something. I always wanted to watch but it doesn't have it. Name is beyblade burst sparking it's a fun anime kids would love it but Netflix don't have it so. I give it three stars ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
I like the app in general but they say that they're the best place to watch movies and shows but what about Dragon Ball super Z all of that what about the good shows and good movies people are willing to watch but they don't have it
Nice app but free hona chahiye
Doesn't have classic movies
"My Netflix is not responding on my Android phone. I've uninstalled n installed too many time but still not responding. Before, when im watching, come out an error."
"Netflix is a good app but I always find myself taking longer to search for the show/movie instead of watching, so most of the time I just rewatch shows."
I can't just swipe anymore to dismiss the app's notif after I stopped watching a video. It's annoying that I still have to open the app and close it again.
"It is too hard to get connected to someone who will listen to ccx what I'm saying we accidentally logged out and I could not make the person I was talking to listen to me! I was telling her we are not computer savvy and vfc to send a text message instead of email,because I can pull the screen down to read the text but would have to hang up to read the email,my grandson finally got us back on Netflix now I'm trying to change the debit card # because Joe Dixon account was breached I'm Darlene"
Since the update I have not been able to turn it so I can watch it landscape on my phone. Its tiny on portrait view.
"Hi Team, I have a Netflix subscription for my phone but not able to play any video. Is there.any issue going on. Kindly fix my problem."
"have a problem with subtitles now . Not able to watch the korean dramas with subtitles , it disappears automatically üò≠ somebody please help or tell me if they are having the same issue."
"Netflix on your phone does not work properly, it is really frustrating as the play button does not work after you pause it."
"I like Netflix I'm just really pissed that it keeps logging me out randomly very frequently, everytime I finish a episode it force logs me out... please fix!!!"
Won't work on my Chromebook since chromebook update and Netflix update. Have restarted device; uninstall and reinstalled Netflix. Message: Device failure occurred. Please try again (500.-1019).
In the beginning when I first got Netflix I loved it it was great now it's has ads but I understand the ads but now Iam looking for something to watch and there is a bunch of gay shows Iam straight y'all need to make a button that if you want to see that then click it but again a straight guy I don't want it .
"Limited choices, out of date shows. Need to update shows and add more choices for prospecting. Why so many fishing shows? Really? Might as well offer golf"
Its a great app ...but from past few weeks my list automatically get removed n i have to uninstall the app and again reinstall it to get my list n data back...its quite annoying to uninstall each and everytime..please fix it...
Good but it lacks more anime. I installed this for anime. Soon I will uninstall it if one piece is not added! I will stop my subscription! If nothing is done! Many of the users is waiting for one piece. Better do it fast to not lose many users.
"Hey, I can't chrome cast anymore! I have lost faith in this app"
It is very easy to use. I love how i can easily manipulate the episodes/movies. And i discovered many more movies! üëç but... Its so hard to sign in
Since the last update I get an error code when I receive an email alert. No other alerts affect it and it never happened before the newest update.
"For some reason it's very glitchy. I have no idea why. When I was trying to delete an account, it wouldn't delete. It would just say profile operation failed. Please try again later (-75) I'm not sure why it says this. But I need it fixed pls üò≠"
3 stars is just because of the fact that it does let you select low quality in download section and it does not work properly in online watch.
It was better when it had different audio options as it has shows with different languages other than English. Needs an update on that
All my movies come up for kids on my phone. cancel my subscription for April
This app lacking too much I mean as I open any movie or series the scene got stop after few seconds but sub titles still keeps running on man I am just passed of this problem I can't watch anything please do something about it
Since the latest update during anything I watch it skips or slows down. It makes me SO frustrated. Bc I can't get through anything while watching on my phone or tablet.
"No in app settings at all. Need to be able to set download destination. Random dowmload limits on some movies, even if to same device."
"Why does Netflix Automatically deduct money from my account, without my control over the payment. This is unacceptable. I should be the one to decide when to pay and when not to. Netflix are you so thirsty for money grab or what ?"
"I love Netflix but I don't like that there isn't much shows that I want to watch,for example,I really want to watch Bixler high private eye.There also isn't all the season's in most shows.fix these problem's and I would give Netflix a 5 star‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
"I think they don't care about anyones interests they didn't bring any latest movies and webseries they just make their own movies,webseries and they think that everyone only like that only. Please I'm kindly requesting you bring some new releasing movies and webseries."
"I hate the fact that you guys like to take off everyone's favorite shows growing as a kid and taking away seasons from shows for a example I want to watch demon slayer season 2 but you guys were like ""mhmm let's be idi0ts and take this and that off"" like come on man Netflix is great and all but the fact you think you can do that is horrible"
Netflix is starting to buffer and even fail more often. Slowly getting worse and worse. Certain titles just fail!
"I personally think that this app is okay, There's a lot of movies/tv shows but the thing is, overtime it becomes boring. Hopefully they can add a lot more shows to watch to!"
Petty good wish you could type in movies that youd like to see too. Plus if you watch one movie different than what you were watching they just send you stuff like the last movie only. I have a big vast likings for different movies and series.
"I'm changing my review because i found that netflix original movies and tv shows are awesome but many titles are not in netflix , i hope Netflix will be the library of all films and series ‚ô•Ô∏è"
Netflix has some problems.. When ever i open any of the episode or movies.. It dosent play.. Keep on buffering.. Even though i have high speed 4g network and youtube HD videos plays without buffering.. Please fix this..
will give 5 stars when 2/3rds of the available content gets unblocked or when i can use a vpn to change my location or only pay a third for the amount of content available. South African Netflix is a ripoff.
Couldn't get it to work at all. Uninstalled and hoping it will work on reinstall.
"It is required to add a notification in the title of Series which are going to be taken out, as people just realize that a Series has disappeared before finishing it.."
"Good quality video and audio too. One problem though, netfix is too late as in movies get old before you see them available"
Everything was going fine binging all my favorites and now this new error code keeps showing up saying please try again later -1009 I deleted cache and storage and yet nothing is helping if nothing is done or solved soon we may need to switch providers
"Black subtitles in some shows are not readable, color and style of the subtitles should be changeable, please work on that."
"This app is great in all, but one problem is that it never releases new episodes even if new episodes of a seris dropped, still It'll take at least a year to release them which makes me and other people really mad."
"It was good to use but it will be much much better if Korean,Japanese etc movies are dubbed in English atleast and added as we don't know the language...it isa hinderance in entertainment"
Its awesome im always watching shows and movies but now it keeps freezing and not letting me fast forward 10 seconds its messed up but I still will use the app just please fix this its driving me crazy lol no hate tho just please fix
"It works fine till I fast-forward a few times consecutively and then it just glitches out and takes me back to home page, and then I have to start my that episode again"
When Netflix removes all Disney movies and shows all I will be left with is The Office to watch for the 6th time. I wish there were better shows.
"I don't know if it's my phone(P30 lite) or what, but this app keeps on crushing all the time when I'm offline üò≠üò≠... Keeps on telling me to restart my phone, please help the content here is too amazing for me to have such bugs and miss outüò≠üò≠"
To be fair this app is great but when the new update came out the screen mirroring feature on my phone connected to my tv then when playing a thing on netflix my tv does not show the vid only the ui the vid on the tv is black pls fix it
"Content library is good but the cost for Netflix has gotten out of hand. Pausing for a few months and will unpause a month at a time to binge then, pause again."
My only concern is how the subtitles can't be seen at times. Watching anime gets hard when the sub blends in with the white background and the words would disappear ;-;
"I like Netflix very very much there are many anime, movies etc. Nowadays I'm watching Naruto shippuden but there is a problem with that ,the action is done but the sound is coming later plzzzzzzzzz üôèüôè fix this please üôèüôè ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫,and please and one piece anime in Netflix please üôèü•∫ü•∫"
"Video streaming quality takes a lot of time to get to the maximum quality of the video even with good internet speeds,being a streaming service this is the primary, it has to be improved a lot..."
"App crash (5.7) so frequently. Which's so annoying that I have to restart my device every times. You have to fix this, don't blame android."
Tubing is my new favorite movie app since everything is free on there but Netflix does have more movies for now and no ads. You have to pay 20$ a month though
Super frustrating that moving forward or backward within a tv episode just to skip the intro keeps resulting in being logged out of the app!
The app is good but the issue i have is only that it do not have vast anime content. If you add animes like one piece then i would think of using netflix till then i will buy subscription of crunchyroll.
"App is good however Inapp casting option dont work with Redmi phones,you need to connect wireless display of phone to cast movies on TV.If netflix is taking highest fees their functionalities shoul also work fine."
Very glitchy app and a shrinking library of stuff you'd actually ever want to watch. Honestly you'd be better on YouTube or 4OD watching for free supported by advertising.
"I have a problem, Netflix works fine on my computer and TV. But on my phone it works but there is only an Audio Stream no video. Android"
"It is what it is..... You can watch, Download films, series. Application design is good for easy layouts and landing."
"For anim√© subs, can you put black background so they can be seen more clearly? The brightness of the animation sometimes overpowers the letters. Thank you."
"Used to be the go to for streaming services but the selection has gone down over the years. Hulu, prime video and hbo max are all better."
Downloading works great one day and will give me errors the next and makes me redownload (which aren't unlimited for some dumb reason). Very annoying.
"Shows are very nice but on the other hand, You can't change the quality and the some shows aren't available in a certain country."
"Very nice app but sometimes, my video freezes while the sound still plays. The app also continues to play a movie even when I'm not active."
"Since the update, the app isn't even working on my phone anymore. It just stays on the black screen with netflix written across."
I am only giving this app 3 stars because sometimes when I tap the resume watching feature it will play the audio of what I'm watching but the screen only has a still image on it and it wont continue playing
The download option is a bit buggy. You have to keep rotating the screen to go through the menus you can't use it in landscape.
"The app is fine , the company , notoriously has great originals , but they literally cancel shows after only 1 or two seasons."
If there is a way for the language audio to stop changing back to english on every episode of a tv show then that would be great ! :)
"I like the app right but.. it's just the amount of shows they remove and cancel especially cancel, so many of my favorite shows have canceled and ended up going unfinished :("
"Annoying sound when loading kid profile. Why Netflix, why? This seems new. Why do you play a fancy animation and annoying sound when loading the kid profile? I can't find a way to make it stop."
Just got my new Samsung Galaxy S20. Video keeps freezing every now and then but with audio on. Never had this issue with my former S10 and current Galaxy A51. Please fix it.
I've had to uninstall the app like 5 times in 3 days bc it doesn't give me the option to cast. Might be a bug that needs to work out. Besides that I love it.
"It was all nice and good, untill few months ago it started...... Whenever I close Netflix (by swiping it away from backgroind) more tham 4 times, I need to reset my phone so that it works again."
Since the last update the Netflix app cannot seem to track what I've watched and when I download shows they just disappear.
Loved the app its good for multiple devices and discomforts are the search and seeking controls the search need to be more about actor name clearly it shows some random movies based on its algorithm
"plenty of current titles and original content. very disappointing selection of slightly older titles, and very few classics"
Netflix is just a whole mood..but the series takes long to produce second seasons on other incredible shows...and somenof the best old school romance are unavailable. Movies like Love Jones and Love and basketball. Other than that I really enjoy Netflix
Main issue is they don't provide English language option as standard for countries like Japan/ Korea. Atleast provide English subtitles but nothing as of now.
"I am facing subtitles issue it is showing totally white, i change subtitles appearance from chrome but it didn't change please solve this fast soon as possible. Its juwt wasting my time"
This app updated and now if I watch something autoplay is buggy as hell and there is now where for me to cast to my tv until I'm already watching something also the cintinuebwqtching section has completely disappeared so now this app is to annoying
hi im using samsung A8 star and using smart view to my sony tv.. however the netflix from phone and tv just the sound with no pictures... both phone and tv is blank... i already uninstall and reinstall again .. same happen again.. can u help or give a tips or two.. thanks
For some reason when I open the app I'm just stuck at the title screen? Even if I wait a few seconds to a minute it's still there. I'm not sure what happened and I don't feel like its happening to other users
"It was working great until the most recent update.. Now after a few minutes into a show it tells me ""sorry we cannot play this at this time. Try again later""... Very frustrating!"
"It glitches a lot. Will play sound but no picture, or loads for a long time just to give an error message."
"App is good but there needs to be a way to access specific types of movies; i.e. horror, action, comedy, animation, ect."
Really good films and TV series. Nice layout. Only improvement is to add person of interest back and add season 5. Except from that great.
"Not showing on tv if video is playing, but I can see when I'm just browsing. The support site says I should the cast, but there's none on my netflix :("
"So after a few weeks of downloading the Netflix App, it stopped working!!! Like I'm literally paying for an app, that isn't working! They ONLY show the trailers, and NOT the actual movies, yet they deduct money directly from my account??? Like that's Not nice at all"
How the hell does youtube whitch is free have picture in picture mode yet Netflix witch is paid does not. I enabled picture in picture within settings and I have the latest updates yet it cannot do it on the galaxy tab S7.
Downloads can not be queued without wifi. Also option for 200% audio volume would be nice since a lot of content is too quiet for public transportation.
"Didnt have any issues with the new ui, but for some reason, the floating mini player has a cropped format now? Super annoying that."
Very disappointed. Subscription reason Friends TV show. Unfortunately episodes are in cut version. Some of the scenes even don't make any sense. But rest cool
What happened to auto play? I'm not trying to keep pressing play after every episode. Fix it please
"I'm not sure if it's just my phone but when I go to watch Netflix with my brightness all the way up the screen goes dark, audio is fine but it's so dark I can't see anything"
The screen keeps going really dark on my android. I don't understand how to adjust the brightness but it's getting so I can hardly see the screen.
I just wish they would stop removing the good shows and there should also be a way to take shows and movies off of your continue watching list permanently without watching the entire show to the end
I love Netflix but I hate that spy Kids is going to be gone soonüò¢üò≠RIP spy Kids.
"Im giving this 3 stars because when i go in it i have lots of data it just goes slow and also this is a pretty good app because they have lots of cool movies however, theres some movies i cant watch it says its not avabilve in my country. Other then that Pretty good"
"For weeks now, I cannot add upcoming movies or series to *My List*. Get notified that it's been added to the list, but whenever I relaunch the app, the movies are not on my list"
Massive glitches in the official release version in regards to multiple devices in the same home on the same account. Netflix thinking the device is not in the area of same account. üòñ
I dont understand why the app is so dark. The brightness tab they provide is barely doing anything and all the shows look dark. My phone's brightness is completely up but still it is only dark on this app
I was wondering how come the movies is not in full screen i use to watch lots of movies from cables and all the movies are shown in full screen how come Netflix can't do it hope in the near future all thr movies will be in full screen
Netflix membrship is a month to month subscription that u can cancel at any time... NO Refund of partial monthly subscription periods A device that streams form Netflix ..and broadband internet connection r required to watch instantly
You anime english subtitle is HORRIBLE. copy from other sites if you can. This is a major deal fo me. I pay premium but still watch anime at gogoanime their subs are better and its free. Im gonna cancel my subscription if you dont improve this.
"pretty good, but I wish you had more animes and asian films. also, maybe have a section for us viewers to leave reviews or something for stuff we watch, I think it would be interesting and helpful."
New self made movies are very good but the selection is not updated enough with the new releases! An awful lot of rubbish!
i am paying 549 pesos per month correct me if i am wrong...to my understanding i can share this account with my family as long as we belong into one household..but to my dismay i am the only one who's able to connect to netflix
The streaming is good quality but I have all notifications disabled yet I still get random notifications multiple times a day. Please fix this and I'll raise my rating.
"Used to love Netflix a lot. But now it seems Netflix decided to remove support on a device I used a lot for it, which is an Android 9 tablet. But somehow have support on an Android 4.4 phone.. How does that make sense Netflix?"
Pretty good but lately the button to scroll through seasons of a show has disappeared?? I open the show and it doesn't let me scroll through the seasons. The button for it just isn't there. I have no idea what's going on
"whenever I open the app for the first time, no matter what show or episode I select, it will always play the incorrect show/episode . every time I need to restart the app to resolve this."
"Your app now always says ""There is a problem playing the video. Please try again. (5.10)"" and I can't even play the videos even if I downloaded them for offline watching. Kindly fix this ASAP."
I like the app mostly. My only complaint is that you're trying to take off my favorite shows like Beauty and the Beast CW and Star Trek. I mean doesn't the people who subscribe and pay for this service have a say so? It's not right to take off people's stuff without their consent.
Recommendations algorithm is very strict. New things should also be recommended. Alot of great shows and movies are unavailable. More documentaries and different genres should be added
"Love the service, but the search function is almost worthless. If I search for a particular actor, I don't want to see movies similar to that actor's work. If there's nothing for that actor, just show me ""No results found."""
Love the app. Only thing I can complain about is that in Zimbabwe we don't have as many shows as the US or UK which really sucks. We also pay the same amount but get less. That is not how it's meant to be.
Needs more science docs. And the top picks for me list is filled with stuff i would NEVER watch. Whatever algorithm they used to compile info on what I like to watch; DOES NOT WORK.
The app is good but I can't watch titles like miraculous. If I search it on Google and enter the site it shows me that is has 0 seasons and if I search it on the app it is telling me that the title doesn't exist. Please do something about it!
Searching for a particular show and it comes up in title bar but when I select it the show doesn't come up. Why list something if it's not actually in there to watch?
I like this but I dnt like its rating system. It should be using star based rating. Would be more appropriate in selecting the shows you wanna see. And also may be a comment section. Becoz then won't have to ask in other social media about the movies you're abt to see.
Whenever I download movies from netflix it won't play but I can watch online without disturbance . And I think every profile should have a specific password. thanks.
"It plays time distractions...movies, programs, etc... Most of the old movies I find that I'm interested in watching aren't available."
It's great until it takes over your brightness. Why even though I DON'T give that permission is still intrusive? :The brightness can't be adjusted because the current app is preventing it. What?
It's such ashame that the playback speed is limited to only 1.5 speed. It'd be great if the speed is customisable to 4.0x speed
I have an issue.. After playing a show a few seconds it starts to glitch until the video pauses and the audio continues
"When it works, it always is responsive. Sometimes, it hangs and doesn't play the selected show."
why have the same film under so many listings ..IE.. romance ..and adventure..and top plck and popular and netfilx original and drama and children etc....using all this space for the same film is just a waste of space for other films not shown !
Netflix you have to fix the offline system for laptops because I downloaded like 20 episodes of a show and when I press my downloads it showed a black screen with Netflix on top left
"I have tried and tried every single time i open this app it shows me. pick a account with smart lock... and when i click it, it dosn't do anything it just keeps puting me back were i started!!!!!"
Please create a watched section apart from the like and add to list. And not recommend something if it is already watched in any other group other than the repeat watch suggestions. Earnest request!
Everytime when i open any video it keeps loading and never starts until i restart my device. On the other hand my internet connection is quite good. Kindly solve this problem ASAP.
"Netflix, please fix your subtitles. The english sub title has no outline or shadows, making it difficult to read when the background is bright..."
A huge selection on movies and shows but all of the shows never finish and there are so many shows that are not even updated
"Sooo developer never updates the new features when theres an update, love that. Havent found any bugs but US version has a trash selection most of the time"
"In subtitles. U should translate whenever they speak other languages than english. What with the [speak in german], [speak in italy], [speak in bla bla bla] caption. ?? U should translate that too in subtitles. So lazy imo. We pay u know."
"Good program but please please PLEASE, add demon slayer movie please I have been looking for it EVERY- DAY please add the movie and I will change my review to 5 stars, please, I really need it its is my favorite Netflix series and good program I love the graphics!"
"The price keeps going up, and good shows keep getting canceled. Overall, a positive experience at least."
"Until recently was good , I originally joined due to the ad watch anywhere anytime on any device. Soon to be cancelled as I'll not be able to leave laptop in hotel as I currently do,Instead I'll have to take it 110miles back home on my motorbike with weeks worth of equipment,clothing and camera gear. Suggestion for hotel smart TV take it home connect to home WiFiü§£ once a month."
Really good app for watching alot of shows movies ect.. but the price is just too much how do you expect people to pay for that. Would use it more if the price went down
It would be nice if the computer version had the speed control. Also why can I cast to a tv at all? When I do it just gives me sound without video even when I've downloaded the movie
App is all fine and good but streaming on chromecast causes battery-drain (constant 20% cpu usage). Please fix.
"I sometimes enjoy watching Netflix, but other times I just get bored of watching the same thing. Over all I think Netflix is great and I recommend it!"
Stated unable to connect to netflix. Done delete and re-install the app yet still the same issue! Please do some thing abt this!
"pleas help i tried to open the Netflix app and it says "" sorry we could not reach the netflix service. pleas try again later.(-14) its been 3 days or so with the same results need help!!!"
It would be better if you could include a rating on a particular movie or series Downloads pause themselves when app is not in use and in the background
Nice app but for a movie app it doesn't have alot. For example if I type in an actor or actress name to watch their movie I never get the right ones and that's annoying to me
Hi i am using one plus 7t and i am not able to cover notch area in my phone to see video in full view screen and this is very annoying. Please do the needful.
It deletes my downloads and there is error codes all the time when I'm watching. My data is wasted because I download things but I don't get to watch them because they get deleted
"Trying to watch show but when i go to home and try to get back to the show, it went blank but the audio still playing at the background.. Please fix this.."
"Please fix it. I've been trying to open my netflix but it says we couldn't reach netflix service -1009, I've been paying in regular basis yet i cannot even use it now"
It's good know but the one thing I hated is that the movie that I want to watch is not on my account but it is on the other account like hey Netflix it's unfair we pay for this and then we don't have the movie on our account and have it on the other like that's unfair netflix You guys need to fix that Its so unfair
Having issues with subtitles. When I disable them the show/movie I'm watching stops shortly after. Please address this issue.
I like netflix alot but there are some stuff that I think alot of people dislike. There are tons of shows that people enjoy tk watch but they keep getting removed. I dont know why it happens but it kinda sucks. Please stop removing shows
"It's a great app, but there isn't a lot of anime's!! Most of the anime's there is it isn't even good!! So please, put more greater anime's.. like my hero academia, wonder egg priority, etc.."
"No doubt , it great but I think it's much better if you expand the choices of dramaa and movies so that people do not need to watch it on other apps."
"IS IT THAT HARD TO INTEGRATE A LANDSCAPE MODE ON YOUR MENU OR THE WHOLE USER INTERFACE FOR A MOBILE DEVICE? ALSO, WHY CAN'T I PLAY MOVIES ON 1440p EVEN WHEN MY DEVICE AND INTERNET CONNECTION IS CAPABLE TO DO SO. VIDEO QUALITY IS ONLY CAPPED AT FHD. YOU NEED A WHOLE TONS OF UPGRADE PLEASE DONT HINDER BEDAZZLE NETFLIX"
awesome app to watch your favourite shows and movies on but i would like it if they start to put the rest of the seasons on off certain tv shows instead of just putting the first 1 or 2 seasons
Netflix is starting to suck they have episodes and seasons that they put on get you watching it an take it off an don't put the new ones on I'm about to cancel my membership it was a great app to watch mostly everything on idk what happened
"It is good, but they keep removing the shows I like. Also, it takes forever for them to make new episodes for somebody feed Phil."
"A great streaming service, the sad thing is there are a lot of great shows like ""the office"" and animes are not available for my region -Egypt- and that's so disturbing."
Its not the same updated app that downloaded to my phone. This one is not organized like my phone into TV Show and Movie categories. Thats a bummer.
This update is really terrible....It was easy on previous version to scroll and explore new movies....Netflix kindly put back the update.
The app is good to stream shows. But crashed twice when downloaded shows. Had to reinstall back.
Somehow it has some bugs. The video doesn't work smoothly in my smart tv. Which is absolutely an issue.
It's such a beautiful app.. You can stream even if u hav slow Internet connection.. Worth to buy it. But I gave 3 stars because I couldn't fins one piece anime in it... Please put one piece anime please
Why is the subtitle all white? I can't read if the video is too bright? Can you pls add the background like color black so i can read the subtitle easily. Thank you
The app is good and i enjoy using it but please can you stop withdrawing money automatically from the subcribers account..most time is our last cash the we are managing before anther monthly allowance and then taking it without confirming if we want to pay for that month or not is sad since most of us are not rich enough to pay consitently but whenever we have money we do subcribe..this is the many reason why think of deleting my account.. Hope you understand my point...thank you
"good app. not fully supported for android tv. the android tv remote app also has a keyboard, please make it usable on netflix."
"My netflix shows this weird UI which makes it so hard to scroll, can't see enough movies in it. How do I revert it please"
Many time I face problem in opening of aap ! Then I have to uninstall it and re instal but still the problem remains tha same ! But the show on the AAP's are just awesome !
I have to put the volume on the TV to its loudest point to get a whisper of the conversation. So I opted for English and subtitles.
I really enjoy Netflix but it would be better if the movies would be more updated and the latest movies and series to be added.
I just realized that Netflix is charging my credit card and my bank account. They are double charging me $15.99 per monthly. Check your billing.
Love it. But it's missing lots of movies that are not featured in my region... Disappointing And It is not working on the Chromebook.
The subtitles lack any differentiating outlines so it is hard to differentiate it with the background most of the time
Still getting into this app but based on daily experiences Netflix is none to have a great capability to kill boredom and keep individuals busy an funky with the fantastic movie's they provide to the youths and odazü§û
"There are a lot of great movies/series to watch, but netflix is getting expensive these days, i'm gonna cancel mine because of that."
Too many series without any continuity. Most series stop at 1 season. Also old series should ve popping up on the choices available especially for new comers to Netflix. Ty
Use to love netflix it use to be cheap and had current movies now more expensive and i think the quality of movies has dropped. No cheap b flicks with no name actors nothing worse then renting something i dont like...
my expierence with netflix is up and down .If i try log into my pre-existing accounts that get paid for it says there are no accounts under that name then it sometimes forgets to take money from my bfs bank account but then takes tripple the month after so please please can you sort it out thank you
Netflix is a good app and resource for movies. Only if they updated more frequently not just newer movies but the Netflix originals as well
"Very biased and one sided with show messages and selections, very liberal. More open neutral options."
I gave 3 stars because I am not able to see which devices are connected to my account.... Please so something about this Netflix... Then for sure I will give you 5 stars.
Love this app! Although recently it's been crashing and I've had to uninstall and reinstall multiple times to get it to work
Offers some great shows but lacks player customisation options and contains restrictions on downloads which vary for different series and are not clearly documented.
I am getting an error while opening netflix movies... The message says...there is a problem playing the video.. Please try again (5.8)..please do needful..
There is something problem in the server because of that I have to uninstall Netflix and then have to re-download it. Please fix it.
It was running fine but facing issues since yesterday and is constantly throwing up.l error while I try to even open the app. Hope this gets fixed soon..
"I dont get why people are saying bad things, I love the app! I dislike the amount of shows, there isn't that many good ones to go through but wonderful nonetheless"
Last update just bugged the screen. I can either havd it with a black svreen just audio or qhen i have screen on... it freezes.
"Everything is good but the reason for 3 stars is the subbers. Since the words spoken never match the subtitles.(no offence, just a comment.)"
"Great app, but please fix some bug's and i cant escape from the intro of the app whne opening it, it just stays like that and never open."
"Well it works perfect but, the data it consume is too much for it to download a movie that's why I will not give it a 5-star they have to reduce their hands thanksüëê"
ever since I updated the app it started working badly like some old crappy game and it downloads movies i didn't even wanna download and doesn't tag the episode you were on correctly beside from that it's not bad
"for the time i've used the app, i really enjoyed it and am planning to continue and upgrade...the app alows me to watch online and download for offline use. Thats why i gave it 5 stars"
"Hi Dev team, My netflix stop working after updating my phone software to latest version. My phone is Oppo A9 2020. Please do something about it. Thank you"
"it's a good app and i like how you can download movie or tv shows, but theres not a very wide selection of movies."
"Its a realy good show thingy, but they keep taking things off, but they take the best things off like they took off Harry Potter, Mia and Me: Seson one, The Last Unicorn and maby even How To Train Your Dragon (I don't know it is downloaded yet it does not work)"
Y'all already know what this is. It works well. Great aesthetics. I kinda wish you had all seasons of each show and posted them as soon as they came out
"App works on the phone, but the stream button (to my TV) does not appear on the Android mobile app. Note, I can stream from Disney."
When I'm looking for films it's showing me it's show me TV box sets when I want to watch films ? I think film should be separate from the TV shows? Visually very good
On Samsung One Ui blue light filter is disabled by Netflix when playing a video. Video enhancer and all other settings are disabled
Honestly its good there is a wide variety of movies. ive just seen a lot of drama movies nothing really good they need to add more variety of movies.
"Status bar doesn't disappear after toggling subtitles on a Pixel 3 running Android 11. Otherwise, app works fine."
"Great app but however I wonder when movies like black panther, avengers and movies like that going to be added unless it's the server I'm in right now but please make sure all movies and shows should be available I'm different severs"
While netflix has good selection of content. Netflix is trying to hard adding political correctness into their documentary.
"I really enjoy the app, easy tonuse across all my devices. I would like to have a ""watched/seen"" option to remove suggestions I have already viewed."
It's gotten alot better however I can't watch a show or movie without it stopping and starting every 5 seonds!!! Frustrating!! May have to unsubscribe!
"Please Netflix, fix the app. I can use Netflix on my laptop but not on my phone, I've restarted it and redownloaded Netflix but nothing happened."
This is a very good app. Please update it in Hindi language some fantasy series It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring but almost series are not available in hindi so please next update including Hindi language!!
I like movies now we are in a crunch and no one can work because of the viruses. We have a situation where we have a lot of time to watch movies because we can't go anywhere. I truly enjoyed the movies. I appreciate your valuable survey. Thank you.
Please change the subtitles back to the format it was .. white words in black background.. now it's only words in white.. it really makes difficult to read subs while watching
"I love the app, except when I want to watch something it ALWAYS freezes. Also, it keeps blacking out randomly for no reason, please fix this"
"Your search icon is black. When the featured show/movie is all black, you literally cannot see the search icon. Fix your search icon or the layout."
"I think You guys need to include more Movies, TV shows and animation !! The movies and shows are not sufficient. Please update."
Great app with a clean UI but the app keeps giving an error when trying to add something to My List or Remind Me. Fix this and it would be a 5 star review.
"They should have also have options like ""movies dubbed in hindi"" so that it's easy to choose and also they should increase the number of movies and web series dubbed in hindi"
"This is actually a good app,but why cant one search for a movie of his or her choice,it will only bring out related ones...and why does it stop midway while watching..which is really annoying..you guys should pls work on this"
my experince till now is kinda ok with 4 awesome 4 series when i went exploring new series i found season 3 of a title but season 1 and 2 unavailable resident evil final chapter is available but the rest were not there.Do you expect me to start from the end or what??
Only seems to update once a month. Mail in was way better. You could actually watch things you liked. And order movies not streamed.
I give em 3 star coz in the free mode they removed download option. We can no longer download movies or series. It so sad Netflix decided to do this without informing us. üò≠üò≠üò≠
Lately the video playing us super jumpy if I get a video at all. The phone app has not been working very well.
Everytime I watch a Kdrama Netflix keeps freezing and everytime I go back into the app the show always changes from Korean to English. Fix that please.
"For some reason I can no longer remove a title from my continue watching list, and it doesn't go away even if I skip to the end. Please sort out this issue."
It is pretty great. Except none of my downloaded or online would play. it has been it works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't
Its a good app but for awhile noslw um... everytime i watch something on here it um likes to freeze up with the circle in the middle like its trying to load but dont know why its doing that it didnt do that beforeü§î‚ù§Ô∏è
"The apps stuck in the black screen, already happen for few days, please fix this issue, its very annoying since this is not free app..."
"Has alot of good shows but it doesn't have enough. It's too limited, you need to get the rights for many more series and movies"
"Netflix suddenly stopped working on my mobile and tablet, but still works on the laptop. I have tried restarting my router and phone but still won't work"
"Love Netflix always wanted it and know have it,but when i search a movie Pacific Rim its not there theres only the movies that are from the home screen like if there isnt alot of the movies that u really want to see in Net."
Keeps cutting off of my TV please help me fix this it will start a show first 5-10 minutes and then cut completely off and do the same thing over Netflix please help me
I'm from Asia and I can't watch some movies/series from other countries please let it be available to ppl from all around the world since we have to pay for the subscription to watch the shows
App rating is 3 because no VR feature works on latest android. Development is slow. Content in India is average or below average. And subscription is expensive.
"Why NO profile password ? When we are sharing subscription with my friend, there should be some privacy on what I see on Netflix, so profile password is necessary."
"I enjoy the variety of shows and series, just wish non original movies changed occasionally. not a lot of new materials."
Getting boted! Nothing new or intresting to watch since so many days! The festivities went like that! The days are passing by. It's so dull here.
When ever I press to watch something it says please log into Netflix again and idk how to do that do I have to unstall then install its so annoying so then I have to go into play store and install it again and like I don't like it so please fix this
This is a great app however some things I would like to watch are not there however if I search it up on google it says it is I would like to watch code geass movies including the new ones and more it's in the US I heard .
why is the picture n picture not working any longer. netflix was my go to app to get me thru the work day but no more. i really hope this can be corrected soon.
It's a really good app and has movies and shows i can't find anywhere else but you took out so many shows and movie and you don't have Santa vs The Snowman 3D and it sai you did anyways good app.
I don't really like it anymore.... Why did they have to remove Maggie and Bianca: Fashion friends? That's a good show! Not to mention that even Fairytale was removed too! Why did you do that to us?
Hi this is a great app. But it should have a LEAVING SOON / WATCH BEFORE THEY'RE GONE section. It's very important for an optimum experience.
I love the app in general and I love watching on the TV but every time I try to sign in on my phone (LG G4) it sends me back to the home screen.
"I lve this app and ive used it before but once redownloading it, ive been given a smart lock log in option and when that shows up the netflix app closes. Im unable to use the actual app?"
App quite good. However it cause the phone running hot and drain battery when cast with chromecast.
I love this app I really do but they got rid of some really good shows like pretty little liars switched at birth and more I really wish they could add them back to I can re watch then because the where so good
Yesterday's update removed the sleep/timer function?! I don't like how it is an account function rather than app setting as to whether you auto play next episode
"Please include patch notes with every update. It's incredibly annoying and frustrating to read, ""You worry about what to watch next. We'll worry about making your watching experience better,"" with every single update. HOW are you making my watching experience better??"
Good app but the reason is the seris wont put my favorite series Meracoulous ladybug and catnoir it has never putted a new series Jane the verjun has way more series then meracoulous ladybug and spmtimes it wont let the movie play on my laptop plz fix it!.
Picture for some reason is showing up Dark as if the brightness was turned all the way down. Uninstalled 3 times and still the same issue
Ever since the update it freezes and I have to exit the app many times and I am now questioning if it is even worth if there is a bug or glitch and it is stopping me from watching so please fix it
"Content of this app is very good, but I am very much disappointed by download system off this application, Netflix cast199 per month and downloading is very slow comper to Amazon Prime Video, on same mobile and same Networks"
"Good quality video, but occasionally messes up downloads, some funny error about switching storage."
"I am using Netflix, I use it on a mobile device but when I try to cast it on my tv then only sound is what I get whereas I am not able to view it. Can anyone help me with this ?"
Had it for years but I hear they are going to start having adds or you pay more to remove adds . If so I will be canceling my service.
Everytime I want to look at what is new or up coming the app glitches out really badly and sometimes I get kicked out of the app. Other then that I like Netflix
great but I would like for them to add episodes of shows as they are released on television because I have to wait until the entire season has aired to start seeing the season on Netflix
"please include Suits Season 9 and How I Met Your Mother in the programs list.. content of netflix is very limited and must be improved, as it is a paid application not the free one!"
love being able to download movies for offline use. sucks that it doesn't have a translation when people are speaking a different language. case in point the mummy 2 doesn't translate when they're speaking Arabic turning on subtitles just says speaking arabic
"I can't watch specific shows when I am in different countries for example when I am in India and i was watching some shows in the USA I can't find them in India. Please make all shows accessible in all countries and pls put ninjago and beyblade burst rise, surge in india pls"
"Would've given a 5 star rating if- 1. it had the appropriate password lock for profiles 2. it had the arrangement for viewing the imdb/rotten tomatoes ratings on all the movies and shows containing in its catalogue. 3. it had brought back the show ""How I met your mother"" in the Indian catalogue."
"Shows and movies from the Pokemon, He-Man, and Sailor Moon franchises keep disappearing. I've tried to uninstall then reinstall it, but nothing."
"It was going great till a few days ago and now the app isnt loading ive tried updating it, deleting and reinstalling it but nothing seems to work..."
I love it but the fact that yall cancelled shows like I am not okay with this and keep making sequels to movies like kissing booth..... it hurts my heart to see some of my favorite shows end after 1 season.
i don't know the reason but Netflix don't work when i play movie at Chromecast. audio is coming with black screen
"Why does some series just leaves people hanging at season 1, for example animes series ""attack on the titans"" s1 was only released what about s2 and s3. It's better not to release the part of the series and leave people hanging. And also plz bring back ratings and the comment section."
Add share button for link sharing and button to add to watchlist on the thumbnail itself.. list making and link sharing is realy difficult as we need to open the details of the movies..
"please add player speed option.. that'll be a great help, I'm a person who watches series at 120-130% of speed.. and i believe there are people who does it too.."

"3days ago my Netflix app stopped working on my mobile, so I've been uninstalling and reinstalling it but that's not working out. Please help me fix this"
"I enjoy Netflix but some famous shows are not here. Also, it got more expensive now. Not sure anymore if it's still worth the price."
I was watching a series in English and when i finished with season one and moved on to season 2 all of it is in Chinese... thy do not have a constant language.
the app was super good but the recent update is not good. the app becomes unresponsive on clicking the play button! please do something about it.

"Netflix is going down with sub standard Indian content starting with sacred games season 2 till the latest comedy Betaal, it's not worth to spend money on it. Btw the App works flawlessly, but consumes more data compared to Amazon Prime"
Please release a feature to save language audio settings for children series. I am really tired of having to change for my son everytime a new episode starts.
I have only one issue with Netflix that why u guys can't dubb korean shows in hindi or in English atleast dubb them in English so we can watch them . There are alot korean dramas but all are in korean language which is very annoying please netflix dubb them
Love the shows but my pictures quilty is so dark can't see them even on the brightest settings. Not like that on my Hulu or prime. So I know it's not my phone.
"You stopped releasing new movies netflix, why? Im so so confused now, and why the hell I cant received new episodes? I have to uninstall/install the app, its getting frustrating, it feels like im wasting my money on you"
"Please add function to remove the recommend or watched movies or series, because its always appear everytime and its annoy me."
"Haven't used in some time because they mostly have older movies I already seen. I heard they have updated with more recent movies, but I have not tried it yet."
I like this app. I can watch many movies....but they remove all the movies that people don't watch anymore. And it's sad that you can't watch it anymore.
"This app has gotten worse, less optimised, unresponsive, casting functionality has gone down the toilet. Give your devs more time to fix bugs!"
Bro... This is india. Lower the rates of subscription. Multiply all the existing plans with 2 and make it the subscription for an year. Many people will then buy your subscription.. And I think you will be in profit. Thank me later but do thank definitely.
"In Saudi Arabia üá∏üá¶ the movies and series are all limited, please fix this, I can't travel to the US just to watch a certain movie or series."
It's good but I'm going to un subscribe because it's getting way to expensive now and they have been blaming covid for it. They won't keep loosing subscribers if they can stop raising the prices it the damn 10th time
y does it give an error sorry we couldn't reach the Netflix server. please try again later. I have just reinstalled the app.
Starting to lag behind other services. ATMOS support on Android devices and other apps on different devices would be a start.
"I have downloaded content before going overseas for holiday, arriving in other country with limited Internet Netflix tells me I changed region and need to download again... Stupid."
When I rewind and fast forward my downloaded content it becomes like mario (pixels become jittery). Kindly look into it and come up with a solution.
look I love Netflix but stop removing shows it's so annoying .. and I just got a new phone and it TAKES forever to load but for other apps it doesn't and please stop removing shows.
with the latest update. its hard to get the title of the movie/series when clicking the thumbnail specially when the picture does not give the title
"When will we be able to remove something from our suggestions? Most of what the app is suggesting I have already seen, either on Netflix or TV or elsewhere, which makes my search for new content difficult."
I love netflix it is just because you guys took the grinch animation off and that was my favorite movie on there and you also took it off during Christmas and it is a Christmas movie so please if it is ok can you put it back at least until Christmas is over......Thanks a lot!!
"Actually, I don't have a problem with the app. Just please don't cancel your good shows. Like CAOS, The Order and others."
The app is great and all but it dosen't have full seosons or the other seosons in some shows and anime. Also some anime is horable but that's just my opinion so yea
I'm having an issue casting onto my TV other streaming services don't seem to have an issue but I don't even have a cast option with Netflix.
Well Netflix likes to take their sweet time making more episodes. Quit producing foreign films that are not good at all. And finish making sweet tooth üòú
It's a good app but they keep removing shows to make room for their Netflix specials which some are alright but mostly a hit or miss for me.
its good but at certain places even though I uad 5 bars netflix won't let me watch the shows but it lets me get on and all my otger apps work.
I love the app and all but why is it that there are many movies that are not on Nigerian netflix but they are on Netflix accounts in america and so on it doesn't make any sense please if possible adjust that
"Please let me remove the show/movie that i already don't want to watch. Because they always at the ""continue playing"" tab. And, bring back SPEED multipliers watching!"

works when it works....just updated the app 4/3/2019 and now can't watch anything. guessing I'll be canceling soon...nice while it lasted.
Suddenly the app is not opening. It is just displaying the Netflix name and that's it for the past 3 weeks.
"Too few movies, many movies disappeared from the offerings; absurd is that many movies do not have subtitles other than English (think French, German, etc);"
Easy to use but I have found not every movie is on Netflix as Netflix needs to upgrade and put every movie on Netflix so you can watch any movie even porn videos
The app is good I get to watch what I want but tell me why my netflix just switched to Spanish and now all the text is in Spanish so I dont understand anything can you please fix this or at least tell me how to switch it back to English
This is frustrating... been trying to log in and it keep saying incorrect password...had to change my password twice but still the same...what's wrong ?
"I gave it 3 because it doesnt have a bunch of stuff like the new movies and animes that i like and i dont like that it doesnt have all the nice K-dramas that i saw people on tictok watch so i installed another app called Gomovies download it,it has all the movies and animes that i like i like that app better plz install it its REALLY BETTER"
Can't update Netflix. It gets updated till 98% and then gets stuck there. Same problem for 4 days now. Please help.
"it is showing error in vedio, when I updated an app till that day it's not working properly. After error screen completely change into green screen"
Only one single audio is available on Outlander Season 2 and that is French. Please check it up and add English to the audio.
Its keeps telling me that the show im curewntly watching is now out of my region and the new season of a show i was watching also isnt there anymore. This has been going on for a while and its upsetting me
"It is an adictive app , where u ll get 5sec to escape from over night watching...there is certain movieswhich is good and not in netflix .its an app where you are suppose to watch wat is in there and not wat you want ."
it's a pretty good app but like there are not series that I want to watch and there are not in Netflix and Netflix doesnt add the other episodes when u are watching a series but I like this app but please Netflix please add the other series and episode to make this app great
"I don't what's wrong but when I'm watching videos gets skip, freeze the screen while movie was on goin. Please fix that."
"Lots of movies and tv shows, but most of the content is bad..low rated movies and all...should have better content for the price we're paying"
"There are a few interesting things to watch, but not many. And when I searched on the internet for a movie it showed that the movie was on Netflix but when I tried to find it on Netflix it was not there."
Changed my subscription without warning to the highest price. Not much to choose from. Too many of the same types of shows.
Would be nice if I can choose my video quality when the video is playing just like every other app and not reducing my video quality to 240p cuz of some network interruption.
I love love love Netflix but the anime is a huge problem in south Africa caus i want to watch the promised neverland but its not out in south Africa and the only other way to watch it is bh going on a legal sites and i dont want to do that so plz Netflix help south Africa n little Oh and my hero academia is only in Japanese and i dont want to read subtitles (its not that im lazy) i want to watch my hero academia and not read XD so plz help us a little out Netflix (south Africa)
"I love netflix.. but unfortunately started lastweek i cant watch properly because some of errors.. like its start from loading, then black screen and the worst is glitching.."
App is fine expect there is this bug that don't let me chose SDcard as storage. Everytime I select sd card it does not change. Please fix it.
"Glitches, freezes, and kicks out the app on TV plus the added extra $5 for an extra screen makes it hard to like."
I m enjoying this app great video quality but for past 3-4 days I m unable to download any video They showing a pop up message delete your old downloads but my downloads was clear Still not able to download more videos please help with this
Netflix really needs to learn what filter means because getting the same movies constantly coming up under different genres is very annoying
"Netflix is not opening at my phone, since last few days. Seriously there is some issue with this. Can support team can help me out the issue?"
Getting worse! Unnecessary stuff and games. Rather than focusing on contents. Looks like soon it's time to leave Netflix
There are so many unfinished shows in netflix which is so much waste of time. I'm thinking about switching to amazon.
"New Ui is too bad, old black UI was good, now grey ui is looking worst infact, please dont make the good things worst, if u cant make it to best, just leave it, but dont do this type of ugly things. orelse 5 stars. ü§ßü§ß"
The last couple of days after an update it will not open just sits on Netflix screen. Have cleared cache and reloaded app still won't run
I taught Netflix is a great app for all movies when u can find any movies but this is wrong movies that I expect to be there it won't be there I was so annoyed and I was hearing that Netflix has all the whole movies but it don't and some series that have come out on the television I can't see them on Netflix and I want to watch everything so can u people change this thing because there are some movies I want to watch and there are not there on Netflix so can u change that
Everytime I watched a movie it suddenly stop .. glitches are unbelievable.. it takes most of the time than the whole movie.
Why is the subtitles not outlined it's should be a easy fix. but it's still not fixed 3 stars for now and 5 if it gets fixed it's just so so anoying.
Disapointed that the shows i did watch and want to watch no longer on app names there but you can view one of a set of movies or no longer watch those seasons available before
THEY TOOK OFF KARATE KID RIGHT WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO WATCH THEM THIS MORNING. VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING. THEY NEED TO BRING IN OLDER MOVIES INSTEAD OF THESE STUPID ROM-COMS THAT ARE NOT FUNNY. YOU GUYS NEED TO CHANGE AND BRING BACK OUR FAVORITES. I AM VERY SAD NOW AND GOODBYE. HAHA SIKE. I NEED KARATE KID BACK PLEASE!! I'M PAYING FOR ALL MY FAVORITE MOVIES AND I EXPECT THEM TO STILL BE THERE WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING.
The movie and t.v shows are great but for some reson the screen seems really dim on galaxy s9 during shows its hard to see.
I like this app but recently it has started cutting out in middle of programs and it turns on the subtitles.
"Hey hai netflixüñêÔ∏è,netflix is worth watching but one problem,in netflix telugu content is very little,please add more telugu content and at least add telugu subtitles for netflix orginals in english,in the world india is watching more online content and in india two states are madly love movies and webseries and online content,the states is Andrapradesh and Telangana these two are Telugu States love‚ù§Ô∏èmovies,If u realese more telugu content in netflix you gain huge profits trust meü§ó."
It always keeps loading and such a waste of time. It's not working in our tv but in my phone it's working.
"Quite often very good, but many times lose visual and have only audio, very frustrating"
Everthing i watch is still in the continue to watch.and movies are writing in english then when u play it its another language for example ..the great heist smh i press play its another language fix it please.
After the recent update the netflix is not been working properly.I am not able to download any content.its so weired. Really patgetic situation from past one week
Recently the app stops and goes to the main menu and also turns on the subtitles?? Why?? Please fix this..
I can't believe the only hindi language is most movie dubbed and series also what about other languages there the more languages people put subscription for Netflix so do all languages dubbed that's my most frustrating the recent days do it dubbed to all language
bring the multi task window back! its kinda annoying not able to watch and multitask altogether.
Good app :) Only HD content shows odd in my phone's screen but I guess this has sth to do with my device.
I have done my payment at 9:11pm yesterday but it was not updated in the app and myoney was debited.again I've recharged at 9:18pm same day then it was updated.i want to resolve my issue or send my money back
"update due? this app is normally perfect but the last week or so its making my phone crash, is it due an update or just got too much content to run smoothly anymore?"
My phone is HDR supported but yet there is no HDR sign while playing videos which suggests that the video is playing on normal 1080p and not on HDR . My phone redmi note 8 pro
"Netflix keep displaying error 1023 in my newer and faster smartphone, but not in my old one. Very odd"
In Australia we get nowhere near as much content as they do in the USA.. I wish we got more variety plus old 80s & 90s TV shows.
"Please Netflix,put English subtitles to Japanese and Korean movies,,im currently in Taiwan but i am a Filipino and i love watching japanese and korean movies but the available subtitles are.in Chinese"
Content lately has been going downhill. Does not warrant the high price. Been a member since 2017 but can't pay 800 rs for content like Bollywood Wives and Indian matchmaking and all. May come back later in case the content improves
Enough with the subtitles! Have to turn them off every time im watching a video or show! Reallying annoying!
Ever since I got an update the app closes out and puts the show on a small screen as in watching a show or movie. Please fix bc I do love this app.
trailers and downloads are working but movies and series are not it just comes upp saying there is a problem woth my payment but it was working a second ago normally i would rate a five but not this time
Sevice and content is king... But recently the serieses are not getting updated after on air in TV. Then what is the benifit of using it. Being a paid subscriber..
Cant watch on phone anymore. Screen too dark. Thinking of cancelling and just stick with Hulu. Who thought dimming on the app was a good idea?
They removed the jurassic park movies...that is unaceptable just for that 3 star review... Didn't even had time to watch the first movie... That was the only reason i got netflix.
Netflix is taking down multiple shows for no reason and do not have all the episodes for some shows.
Good app. The only thing that is missing is that it should have the volume adjustment while watching the video
Need improvement. Like why do you pause my downloads if I'm playing anything in your app. Why don't I have customization option in the player like mx player n all.
So far i think i would rate it 3 star becoz my netflix never works like before üòëi have to restart my device now and thenü§ßand that is a total wastage of my tymüíîI hope u fix this problem the next updateüò™
"I liked this until the last update, and now my picture in picture no longer comes up when I open another app. Please fix or tell me how!"
"hi please convey this information to the NETFLIX management admin. First of all, I am very satisfied with the system and the content of movies available on netflix. HERE I REALLY HOPE THAT NETFLIX MANAGEMENT CAN MAKE A REQ FOR SUBTILE BUTTON FOR MOVIES / DRAMAS THAT ARE NOT PROVIDED WITH SUBTILE B. MALAY / OTHERS. this allows viewers who really want to watch to get the experience of understanding the story they are watching. there are also children / parents, who are not fluent in english"
Loses my spot in the show any time I tab out. It never remembers where I was at on my show and it always puts me on a random episode at a random time.
"Not able to find movie named "" A Wednesday"" through the search option in the app. But we can find it through Google. Please rectify the problem."
Please bring back the are you still watching feature. Make optional if it's bothersome to others but it was so useful.
"App lags a lot. Once u pause at a scene, on resuming the audio and video goes out of sync."
The app is quite nice but recently I am facing issue with an error code 5.x sometimes and after that either I have to restart handset or have to re-install app.
"Whenever im trying to open netflix this error keeps coming *sorry we could not reach the netflix service,try again later (error -1023)* Please tell me what should i do?"
Last update doesn't work. There is some error showing while trying to play the video.
I can't seems to download movies/ TV shows that I want to watch offline after the update please fix this problem. thanks.
"I like netflix but unfortunatly most of the shows that i want to wach are not on netflix, i think it might have to do with me being in Australia? IDK, I just wanna watch supergirl :-("
Should add a feature for users to see the new movies or tv series added on Netflix. Will really help to watch more international tv series
"Keeps showing message ""could not play title. Please try again later. (5.8)"" tried multiple titles and still not working."
The app is very good but if u watch anime the subtitles are wrong and skips the comercial like information about something pls fix it
"I hate that now I could no longer control the brightness of my smartphone while on the app, gives me migraine and could not watch longer than I used to."
The app is pretty good but sometimes when i open the app it just shows netflix anthen ntg else. It stays like that for whatever the time is.
"Thus app is nice but it dose not let you watch offline without downloading , I will like every one to download , if u like watching movies similarly serials and etc i would suggest Netfilx and Prime video followed with Hostar Please replay"
The app is good but you need more interesting exciting movies like Canada's Netflix. I barely even watch Netflix anymore because of this.
"Mostly good,. Could you possible give an option to remove Intro like an account option or just remove them all together, thanks."
Basicqally since new minecraft story was released all videos have been lowering in quality mid stream. Also the minecraft game countdown is way too slow or shouldn't exist at all.
Everytime I turn around there is any update. And when there is the app want work. I had to do 3 in one week. Can you please make it where the updates dont affect the app
Good but please add black outline on the subtitle's font. I can't read it most of the time when I am watching K-dramas.
App is good but the payment options they provide are very limited and sometimes it becomes impossible to pay even if you are willing to do so
I used to love it but got a glitch which removed next episode and skip into button in is there in my other phone on same episode of same series just not there on my phone please fix this
"Not playing well..screen shows green color and video is not at all visible,phone is hanging when this happens"
The closed caption sucks sooo bad I don't watch some series or movies because of it.. who the f thought black lettering would go well with some cinemas!?! I'm gonna unsubscribe soon if an update dose not come soon üôÑ
"You should allow screenshot but with Netflix watermark and please give options to the video settings, I don't give a f if I have slow internet but wanted to watch my movie on highest quality..."
Stop cancelling all MY favorite shows & the best shows you have!üò† It is really pissing me the fawk off so am spending more time on HuLu now where their NOT pissing me off!üò°I thought this WAS supposed to be the best & progressive for the customers but apparently not!üëéüòà
"Netflix needs a major update, hate that I can't get certain American shows like supernatural! Other than that it's good."
It's got a lot of good stuff to watch but what I don't get is why only have 1 session of a show when there is already more than 3 sessions out of a show what is the point let's say my hero academia you only have 1 session of a 5 session show why?
"It's always worked fine and now all of a sudden it's not letting me open the app nor is it letting me uninstall it. When I try to update nothing happens, so what do I do??"
It's have lot of good shows and movies i like mostly anime shows but i wish there is a lot of English dub version of anime also available please try to give dub and sub version together
"Not All, clearlynot every movie that you'd want to watch could be found in this app. At least not for my version or whatsoever. So i give this a three."
"Fr the past few days i had to logout, login, uninstall, reinstall for like 15 times. no response from CS. Though i hot good internet connection it's making me do this stuff"
"Laggy, always buffering and otherwise disappointed. Three stars because it works sometimes."
The only thing I would add is a list of watched series /films. I hate scrolling through the ones I've seen before.
Difficult to find something new / different to watch. I believe It could be designed a lot better.
it's great but it lack some films like one piece and others and also seasonal films are not usually complete mostly interesting ones
Netflix is not loading over wifi. It works perfectly on 4G though. Is there a fix for this?
Love the variety but it's getting ridiculously expensive... thanks netflix for raising pricing when everyone started to love the app !!
"While i love the way,the movies have been segregated.I would like My saved list to appear on top of other sections. Is there a way we can prioritise the order of the sections as per our wish?"
Good shows and movies. But I hate that it doesn't go full screen on my S20 ultra. Disney+ does it.
"Unable to watch downloaded episodes and movies on my phone, since the last update. Please fix."
Something i wrong..now if i try to open it using my phone it got stuck at the Netflix Logo page...but if i use my xbox1 or pc it doesnt to have any problem with it
The only problem is that I can't choose video quality..... It automatically set according to network .... that's a bad thing I would say üòï
I mean you know it's alright it's not the best but like some movies have been pretty cool to watch honestly the selection suckedbut there's no ads soooo... lol
i have expirience that there is no video at all... audio is good and subtitles.. but there is no video.. why us that happening?
"Why netflix disallow screen mirror? I watch movie on my monitor using cable from my phone but sadly the subtitle doesn't appear. If i use desktop mode, only black screen with subtitle üò™üò™üò™üò™üò™üò™üò™üò™"
Best app so far. But frustrating thing is that we pay the same as US. So why they getting more content than us. WHYYY I can't even access to it with VPN
"Please include English subtitles in anime for users based in Japan, not everyone there speaks Japanese, some of us are actually on trips there, please, thank you"
The app doesn't always do what I command e.g if I want to remove something from the row and when I click continue watch I have to click three or four times to get it working
3 star because it needs more anime but other then that netflix should get naruto shippuden on netflix cuz i fell like watching it in dub and not sub dont get me wrong im ok with sub but i wanna watch dub cuz it pretty nice knowing the thung that there saying but sub has more voice acting and nicer voice acting
Have been trying to call the help line but it isn't working. Am being deducted twice a month one high than the other and I don't understand why.
"Everything I watch on the app is very dark on my Samsung s9. Every other device is just fine, just the mobile app is dark. Please fix!"
"Awesome but in other countries they might not have as much TV shows as the rest of the world some poeople are missing out on some shows ,movies and TV series"
"The reason I give 3 star is I want you'll to keep a payment where we can pay all together once a year, like a year membership, because paying every month is quite annoying, so please give a option Of one-year membership üíì"
There is no fast forward button with chromecasting on my phone. It is very sad.
Good service overall yet has been having issues with not being able to find previously available titles. Do you erase titles after awhile?
I love Netflix but would be better if you didn't have to manually switch off captions every episode.
"It crashes sometimes, and cannot playback if i restart the app again. cannot play the one im watching"
Overall its okay but i had cancel the payment but it didn't do anything messages keep coming say that i had paid for this month but i had canceled it..this had been going on for 2 months already please please fix it
Just updated the app and now the cast button for the Chromecast has disappeared. Please fix asap!
"Why always ""cannot reach the Netflix service"" ? I can't login. Already install and uninstall then install it back. Still same."
giving it 3 Stars because after the recent update the subtitle arent working and the mini screen feature is gone. please bring em back
"does not work with android pie on note 9. gives a ""device failure, please restart"" error, even after reinstalling."
I have a new device (Lenovo Tablet) and is not reproducing the video. Controls and sound works but idk what is it.. I send an email hoping they can resolve my issue *sad face*
I don't like to logging in with a different user in my account but still unable to access the downloads from the primary account!!
"I'm honestly upset how many movies and shows they have taken off the app, such as 'Jessie' or 'Earth ro Echo' Other than that the app is pretty decent."
Great updates but still many features and shows missing. Please listen to those who request for new shows. And add more languages to each show.
"The app doesn't open on my new phone even after downloading it again and again. Although, it works on my old phone."
I have not used Netflix app on this device in a couple of weeks and everyday it still drains about 10% of my battery!
this app has many movies and serials but some of the serials are not completed and this is very bad and the app have very few shows children so I rate it only 3 stars
I'm unable to make payment everytime. There's this error message that pops up. Tried everything it's still not working
There are some series that are not completed in seasons but if you watch through the other sites you may have seen the missing seasons in a series
I cant Uninstall it this is my mom's old phone so I don't use it and it's so much storage so I need to uninstall it but I can't not trying to be rude Netflix I watch it on tv
It was soo perfect till now but this time you have removed the download option which is very heart breaking üòû We people save net and download everything but you simply removed it which make me not to subscribe it anymore üòë
"Conent is immersive. I wish to have more content with no bad language, which I can watch with my family. I like UHD, Dolby Vision support."
"great, but recently whenever i open the app, it just freezes at the logo, wont let me choose an account. would he a 5, but because of this problem it is now a 3."
Recent App Update Has messed up the whole experience by making changes in the UI earlier it was way better. We don't want it
Sometimes it doesn't open up properly on my phone and says there is an error. But when it works it is brilliant.
"Why does Netflix's new update suddenly require the untogglable permission ""route calls through the system"" ? Very suspicious. No way I'm updating."
"it has some of the best shows and movies, but it constantly takes off/ replaces good ones."
Dubbed to hell. No new content. All non English foreign dubbed low-grade content. Netflix used to be the best. Now it's almost the worst.
"I really like this app, but there are no movies that I really like. I would love if there were Disney movies on it. Please, please, please, please, please, please, please put them on Netflix, especially Brave. Please read this and take my advice, everyone loves Disney movies!"
"It's a good app but I dislike that I have to wait over half a day for a new show to come out when it should've already been out, it's the release date but you make us wait till like 6pm for it."
Look. I love this app. But it's sad that it's been a long time and the seasons are liked maximum 6. I used to love this show called adventure of puss in boots. And I want you guys to make season 7. But I heard someone said u canceled it. Which makes me very upset. I've been crying of season 6. I would put a 5 star if u make season 7 to adventure of puss in boots. Your app... Is very upsetting.
Twice this has happened now. Been logged out and physically cant sign in. Sister was receiving emails saying that were getting logged into from all round the world.. joke
Its ok and all but when I press on a series or show it says jnable sometjing then random digits idk whats happening it doesn't do it to all shows but it does it to the ones I wanna watch
I would give it a 4-5 stars but I have it a three...the only reason I gave it a 3 it's because they dont put in some shows that I wanted to see like Naruto Shippuden but if they did add it I would maybe gave it a four star bc I just cant any shows that I usually see
I love the movies..Netflix is number 1 but then not all movies appear here for example 50 SHADES DARKER. I have to subscribe both showmax and Netflix
This app should support full screen view in mobiles with punch hole camera in it. It will make better viewing experience.
I am now watching some series then for some reason the app did not work it always says error you need to restart your phone and i did it already but still not working now im upsetüò¢ please netflix let me know what going on
"The movies and series are repetitive. Hardly anything new. If my husband and son weren't enjoying it, I would have cancelled it."
Its cost is more than it's worth . If you have enough of internet and enough of time than only you can buy.
"I am facing an problem sins i have downloaded this app, when ever i have to pay my plan, this app or even it's website doesn't help out. Either i have to wait an entire week oe redownload the app. Please fix this!!!"
Is good but that good when ever I watch a movie the screen some times froze and the sound you know also BRING THE OLD MOVIES THAT EVERYONE LOVED IT. WOULD.BE.HELPFUL‚ùóAND means a lot to everyone ‚Ä¢w‚Ä¢
Netflix is pretty good u rlly need to put better children and family movies on there. And bring back the originals and pretty little liars.
I gave it a 3 star because there are alot of movies and shows that are missing half of . I would have to wait like three more years by the time they have them come out
I can't press play. I can pause the show but I cannot press play...I have to press play by pressing the -10 sec button. Pls fix
"Good, but There's a glitch that happens all the time movies disappear and even when l search for them l cant find them. I have to go to google then come back via google"
I like Netflix as it has some amazing shows but I won't give it 5 stars as it gets rid of all the good shows for example sowrd art online and attack on Titan which are great animes and they have removed it
I like it because it's funny shows but they just need to add some better shows that everyone has been asking for like bring back 5 standing ovations back or dear dumb diary or mckenna the american girl doll story like bruhhh.
I try to watch episodes or Movies from the app. Streaming or downloaded. The thing keeps signing me out while watching anything
"it's been months and I've tried all the trouble shooting, the cast icon is still missing on my netflix."
"Hello team, Why NETFLIX taking tym to open i am using wifi which is high speed..first the app doesn't open after 8 to 9 tym it is open why....palzz help me out."
Why after the adding of card it asks again for verification and had only blank page of white colour .... waiting so many time also it's hot signed in ...please tell me immediately the solution for this problem
Most movies that i wants to watch are not available and cast option is also not available for Android that's kinda poor thing for app
"Wants me to subscribe without trial of free , one months. Starting me with paid subscriptions for premiums of $. 15.99/month. I'm not going for it, Lol!"
Would give 5 stars but it does not support HD for the S8+. I'm sure you guys make enough money to keep up to date with new phones.
"They are going to take good shows out just for the hype house show, not trying to be mean but why them like they are just tiktokers just do tik tok instead of canceling good showsüôÑ"
"There should be HD / FHD in mobile plan. No way any sane person should buy ‚Çπ 649/ month for thereself alone to get HD. While mobile is for 1 person which suits me, HD is something as basic need in 2020."
I'm unable to open the app from last 4 days it pops up with we couldn't reach to Netflix service provider please fix the bug
Great app when it works. I am constantly uninstalling and reinstalling because it won't play anything.
Not all content available to watch. All the Netflix collection should be made available in all countries.
"I can only watch SD quality on my S22 Ultra even though I have an Ultra pack. Its just sad. To solve that, I have to uninstall the app first, restart the phone and reinstall it."
"In general, It's very good but I hope they consider to add more films and series to the MENA region or for it's access in Egypt."
Quite a good app but not much choice probably this is just personal preference and ther is choices a plenty but for me this has hardly any choices that I like.
The season 2 episodes of sacred games is not getting displayed correctly... hoping u will fix this soon.. if not that.. definitely this app gets all 5 stars
Please remove all the Chinese movies it's flooding Netflix and it's not even good otherwise the app is very good would say it's worth the amount I pay but with all the Chinese movies it's a rip off
They keep cancelling shows. I just unsuscribed after many years.... they raise the price yet cancel most shows after one season or two...
Netflix is a great app but recently they have been taking down a lot of great movies that should not have been taken down and they keep up the bad ones.
I really like this app however after the latest update mine no longer opens on my phone at all and comes up with errors if it manages to . Normally 5 star
I can download very fast in this app but I think it's better to put more Movies and Tv Shows because I can't find my favorites that I want to watch again.
No chrome cast option but superior picture quality. Since there is no chrome cast i feel its not effective to invest 200 rupees per month.
"great app but shows/movies need to be updated more often. also bring back lock up! new eps, or old. or add more decent prison shows! and maybe some more newer movies?!"
"great app until I have started to get 101.1.8 errors, stop you watching down loaded program, I have uninstalled and reinstall the app but to no prevail."
Nice app. However it drains my battery whenever I open the app. There's always media server in my battery stats consuming a chunk of battery.
I don't know what's going on with netflix today but I cannot open up my profile I am the main member and my profile is the only one getting errors 1014 or something fix this and I'll fix my review
This app is good content vise and user friendly experience. But this app is crash every single day I am having one plus 6 for reference if developer is reading this comment!
This app doesnt allow you to take a screen shot anymore and some of the seasons of the series i used to watch some of em were deleted
It should be 5 stars but it okay and all but you guys should add like more anime show like My Hero Academia and stuff and not long ago you guys added like Dora and stuff (sorry for saying stuff) but just add like my hero academia and more anime shows.
"Watch all your favourite movies on the go, but doesn't have alot of classics, always gives alternatives."
"I'm a conservative movie watcher...I find Netflix to have MORE of what I DON'T want to watch, than otherwise....I love goodness, realness, wholesomeness....."
It's a great app but sometimes my video is delayed and the experience is not great after that please help me out ASAP.üòä
Don't like the new up date would rather just Click on movie to read what it's about!! Takes up too much space on my TV covers the other movies!!
"It's a good app but uv got to improve on payment sector's try finding other ways on how pple should be paying, its difficult when one does not have a credit card"
"Is good but if you use Android box selection of channels is difficult, you have to do something about it to display the icons on the screen"
"Could include a little more content but Harry Potter, Sonic The Hegdgehog and the Alvin And The Chipmunks movies not being there is a failure but just in case put the first four movies of Harry Potter in kids mode."
Latest app update is a scam it is always loading and sometimes it appears that there is an error during sign in. Wth
"I love netflix however, there are a lot of movies I don't watch.So if the price gets any higher I¬πm switching to hulu. ü§∑"
i have a huge problem. sometimes i try to watch a show only for it to get a black screen with sound. other than that it's a good app
This is a good app and its simple and all but it gets a 3 star because they took a lot of the 80s movies off...and that makes me sad..so..other than that good job
"The app is good but there are no other famous movies available when you search it for like harry potter, a walk to remember, little rascals, narnia amd barbies. It should also avail for old movies."
What's with constant weekly updates? I've turned them off and haven't allowed any for about 2 months. It still works!!
"Please add a stop or pause in between episodes, must have feature because it eats more data esp if someone snooze off"
"I gave it 3 stars because, all of a sudden it has way too many ads. I can't watch a movie in peace, please stop the ads."
"lately the application stopped working on my samsung tablet, I deleted the application and installed it again multiple times and it doesn't work"
So before I was watching unknown the lost pyramid I have subtitles pilipino and then the next day it was mess all the subtitles and audio has so many languages and no pilipino subtitles can you pls fix this?
Love Netflix! Their original shows are amazing but they get you hooked and then cancel them without any real conclusion.
Hi I just wish America had more shows like modern family and others. I just am bored and I have to get a vpn and it is a lot more boring with American Netflix. üôÇ
it's alright I just wish they added the good shows like full house or boy meets World. I don't like how they keep adding their originals
It is great and cheap but many good movies or shows are either not available or is available in other languages.
"I'm not sure how to put this. If you know viewership drops off, why not close out the plot sooner. Awesome, otherwise."
"Since the last update, captions have appeared and even after turning them back off, the start up again the next time I use the app."
Normally runs smoothly however has recently played the audio of a show or film and the video is paused randomly
Why does My list not show the series I add on there? ----------------- Update: March 2020 - resolved. Almost never can use the share option to Netflix stories. Pls check.
"Ok, i have been waiting on this one series for EVER and it has over, maybe 4 SEASONS!! Like SERIOUSLY!!! Maybe you can try to upload those faster? (Im talking about transformers prime... Basically every transformer cartoon actually)"
Well first of all Netflix should stop logging me out every time I pause a show or try to skip ahead a few seconds.
"Other than the screen going dark every now and again, and me having to delete and reinstall the app, it's great. That's why I gave it 3 stars. Fix it and I'll give it 5."
For some reason I can't pause it. It's not leting me unpause. And I have to go back 10 seconds. For it to work.
"Hi team, I'm not able to find the mobile+ plan for rs.349. I consume the Netflix on mobile predominantly. But if I'm able to find the mobile+ plan Incan start consuming from my pc. Mobile+ plan is it released officially? Regards, Govind"
"Netflix was good, its just episodes are kinda late to be released on netflix.. as a weeb like me, i have to wait full seasons of anime for months, maybe a year like you know its really boring to wait that long..."
I'm sorry but the app keeps crashing and freezing and won't allow me to watch movies peacefully.
Very good app. Only problem is that I am not able to cast to chromecast. I am not able to see cast icon in the app.
The REASON why I have 3 starts is because they don't really have enough horror movies that I wanna to watch and I was wondering if the company can make it more sooner l... :)
"Pretty great overall, but the age rating on shows are constantly changing, which is both good and bad"
I swear if this Flippin App keeps making me log in to my devices... I'm gong to cancel it.. I don't watch it enough to deal with the inconvenience
I gave this app three stars because when I pause a movie or a show when I tried to resume it just stay stuck and won't resume again.
since the new update I have not been able to watch anything at all. the screen keeps freezing on my phone. please sort it out
The selection of things to watch has been dwindling. And most of what they take off is what's worth watching.
There is many good shows/movies on here don't get me wrong but everytime I try to click the download button on the lower right corner it kicks me off
To be honest i feel like im wasting money on this because it dont have all the movies and and some movies that have sequels does have all the parts. SOONER OR LATER IM SWITCHING TO AN ANDRIOD BOX
I really enjoy watching shows and movies but I just don't like the fact that people from other places have more movies and shows.....atleast let us all have the same stuff
I m totally disappointed ....whenver I update netfix from playstore...the downloads from my account is missing...all the chapters would be deleted...after open Netflix again Sign in procedure is shown...
Netflix has been my most used app since i have been staying home because of covid-19 but my account has expired and im trying to start a new membership to premium tas lumilitaw sa taas na something went wrong. Please try again later i dont know if its just me?
"I pretty much like the app. I do wish there were more selections of the classic movies, especially in the Western genre."
It'd a great app but when it's comes to anime on it it's not to bad but I wish there were kor eoption plus for it to update one anime or movie takes along time even though the seasons already came out years ago üòê
Netflix is really good but I have just found out they are removing Julie and the phantoms and I'm so upset so I'm not going to lie I'm going to stop waching it just for this reason it's such a good show and it's absolutely ridiculous idk why I even gave it three
The new update removed the brightness toggle while playing. Bring it back. It's one of the best features
Netflix is becoming boring the series have become less and there aren't a lot of family like movies!! But I've loved Netflix so far please try adding more series and movies
"Subtitles disappear too quickly, please consider leave subtitles longer even though audio is gone."
"The app has always been working until the latest updates , it freezes way to much. Please repair the issues"
netflix is a great app ive been using for years but when i use it one mobile all most all of my shows free up i can still hear the dialogue but i cant see the show?
I was happy watching Netflix but it's no more going through so I have to uninsall it
"Your App takes a long time to get started. Pause for a coffee break or supper, the app goes off. One has to start from scratch."
"Keeps pausing my downloads, which is a hassle when I'm going to be without service for hours and I think that my downloads are moving as they should."
"The subtitle is only in white color, when the background is white or other bright color it's hard to read the subtitle"
"Use to be great now they remove most of not Netflix shows, charges more and do not allow multiple downloads unless you pay more. Very sad how it changed for the bad."
I can't download the videos I want to watch and it is saying that I've already downloaded too much and on other devices to but there is no other download.
"This app is working just fine with a lot of good features, and the latest update you just make it worst, some of the features were gone."
Netflix does not start for days together after an update on my S8 galaxy phone. can this issue be resolved? it has happened again
"The app keeps crashing and i can't log in and i have to delete all my data and redowmload everything, don't know if it's just me."
"It's really good but when I logged in and try to watch shows or movies, it keeps kicking me out. So I can't use it on my phone."
"option to play in different resolutions like 720p ,1080p etc should be added,moreover in settings i didn't find what quality of resolution coming on my device,any answer?"
Works perfectly with chromecast! Just waiting for more horror movies! Thanks Netflix.
My recent phone was lost. Now am using my old phone. Doesnt netflix allow samsung note3 to access the app? Thank you for answering in advance.
"hey, i don't know exactly what happend to me but my account of netflix have paid for one month in a low that totally twice. i don't want to losing my money anymore so i wanna get claimed about this"
Good but not best. Some series got canceled which is annoying because those series is really good for e.g santa clarita diet that left us with a cliffhanger ending. Hoping all series has ending that its not cliffhanger.
Scrolling through the coming soon tab causes the app to glitch graphically black horizontal bars and duplications of items and sometimes crashing my phone
"Video qualities are superb, but app doesnt have the Rupay card available for India, which is a big issue for me. Try to add the Rupay debit card option too asap."
Ever since my phone updated the app is telling me certain titles camt be played that played just fine before thr update. Dont know how to fix it.
Every time I'm facing this issue.when I open the video in netflix I'm getting reboot automatically. Pls fix this issue ASAP
Its OK I just dont like that there are missing season. But i like it that it haves lots of animes. If the episodes and season are complete it would be greateüëå
Ur app is really awesome but there is a problem I just subscribed with premium in ur app rn like now and I was excited to watch my fav movies and series but it shows that every movie or series I wanted to watch is not available in ur app why? I mean I just subs in ur app for watching my fav movies and it shows up that I only can watch what do u have not what I wanted I mean this is kinda like a scam I mean if this is the fake Netflix I want my money back so please add all the movies we want:(
I'd give it 5* if there was an option to remove movies or programs that u didn't like from the continue watching option. Change that n I'll give5* for abling to remove programs :)
I love Netflix. I just feel like there isn't enough shows that i enjoy. I kinda wish there was more anime. Overall it's a great app.
"can you please update the movies and series in time especially old animes. we are not paying monthly to wait, we are paying to watch recetly movies and updated series."
The app is great bt i constantly face issues during payment every month...after adding OTP it automatically redirects to 1st page of payment..i have tried several times but showing same result pls fix this
"I tried to watch some Netflix today, but it kept closing the app and it wouldn't work. Otherwise, it's a great app! Love it!"
Netflix app is not getting install in my device. It disappears after sometime. Issue with download... Pls fix it..
subtitle occasionally out-sync which does not happen on smart TV client. Love the download function.
I like Netflix. Not only is there a good selection of movies & shows but I like downloading to watch off line & u can do that here on Netflix
When I lock screen the Shows that I watch I cannot unlock it again it will not touch so I have to return Home and Exit the app again to change the show's that I watch
The app is fine but it gets boring for a while so please add more shows anime especially and listen to your audience about what to add and remove for more entertainment.
"It's good app.. Really.. But they have no desiney, add this ok.. And one more thing you are the best time waste application ever.. But I love Netflix.. And don't add Bollywood movies .. ü§ó we don't need them"
"I can't open the app and watch because it keeps telling me to upgrade, and I checked the playstore for updates but it said there's no app needed for updates."
"Older movie favorites are not available. Too many spaceman. Transformers,etc. Thank Goodness for TV series, PBS series offering realistic shows."
App is trash. Constantly downgrades quality on mobile devices for no reason and there's no fix. Stop downgrading my mobile experience that I pay for. Widevine L1 on al ldevices. Capped at SD quality. Pay for 4k HDR. Fix it
"Can you add a Remove From ""Continue Watching"" option?? and suggest movies and TV shows too. MANY MANY ones are not there"
I just have one problem.. payment options are not versatile.. here in india atleast accept rupay card. I have seen many prople who want to buy the packs but can't because u guys do not accept rupay. Its just bad buisiness for you all.
Does not accept Diner's cards. And pretty expensive compared to Prime and Hotstar. but otherwise decent platform to watch a host of sitcoms and movies.
my internet speed wouldn't be able to speed up in app...other wise in ither apps it is working properly.
Works well but suddenly says cant reach to netflix service. I find nothing to fix it. Why it goes like this suddenly.
Overall good but suddenly can't change volume without it instantly muting first. 5 stars otherwise. Hoping for another update soon!
It's so blury and out of focus it isn't worth the money I pay for it each month. It hurts my eyes. So disappointing.
"They need to bring back some syfy TV shows, and a little expensive. But overall glad I have my Netflix..."
"Works good on my phone. but not on my Smart TV's, always a problem. getting tired of it not worth my money."
I keep getting error message. We couldn't reach the Netflix service. Try later (-1001). Please suggest what should be done. Not happy at all.
It's good but the reason I picked 3 stars it's bc of the verify age thing it's really annoying I can't watch jjba and stone ocean is coming in December 1 but bc of the verify age thing I can't it's really annoying I hope you can fix it
Damn this would have gotten a 4 or maybe a 5 but it keeps freezing when am watching staff on the app.....and this is so annoying you better fix thisüò°
"It is good but some movies are not available. So according to thr monthly charges, we should be getting more varieties."
I love it as it have variety of shows etc etc but i always have problems with the black screen with sound :/
"I dont know if this is not a netflix problem but it keeps crashing. Other than that, it's really good"
It's an okay app it's good but the movies choice release could be more interesting and update series of TV shows don't come like sfter an year after the entire series was released
"What happen for the subs setting, I can't read the subs, I have change the setting from web, but after I go back to the app, still same all white can't read"
"it provides a excellent viewing experience, but its not a very energy efficient app."
Love it. Is the source to kill boredom in the current situation. Giving it a 3 star so they notice my comment & add the original French audio for Intouchables
Please jmprove the server. More lightly. Cause when i try to watch the buffer is to long. It was iust with metflix. When i try to watch other it's okay at all
"App and content is great‚ù§Ô∏è, but number of people using at the same time should be increased atleast to two, i paid for my family to watch too.üòí I'm disappointed while my babe ask me to logout üôÑ..cz she wanna watch something else ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è -untold truth"
I do not see multibale movies to choose from. When I press movies only one apears fustrating.
was great untill last update. my phone started to restart by itself. uninstalled it phone was great. reinstalled it the other day now phone restarts randomly again
When I pay every month for this subscription why is it showing Sorry we couldn't reach Netflix service please try again later (-1023) but why? Please look into it.
Why isnt it working since the update??? Doesn't play most of the content just keeps loading and unable to connect. Fix this please.
It is really a good app for watching movies But I am having a problem I am not able to cast Netflix to my tv The cast option is not getting shown.
I like it I just don't think it's worth $15 something dollars to watch on only 4 screens it should be 10. For one and 15 for any t.v. screen under that address.
Is it just me or is every other version of this app broken? Hangs between every episode needing to be shut down and restarted before it will load and play again.
After update the newest version of netflix i fail to open videos on my realme x2 pro phone but when i sign into another divice with the same id the videos are opening.so please help me to solve this problem
Not rating the content but the app only. I cant find how to get full list of programs sorted in alphabetical order. Can someone advise?
"Like most of the shows. They show me the SAME titles on my feed, nothing new pops up. I may just get rid of it."
"I use this application, so far so good. only unfortunately the internet at Indonesia almost all providers are blocked. Please maximize the internet service. Regards"
Too many bugs. I have to restart my phone just to play videos mostly. App wont open even after updating. What. A. Joke.
"Overall it's really good to watch most of your favorite movies or TV shows ,only problem is not every tv show has all the seasons as it usually has on tv"
It's good but the thing is when your looking for a movie or something it's either not on there or jut not popping up other then that it's a really good app so I would definitely get it
I hate the üëçüëé rating Less then 5 star or üëçüèªs is an insufficient rating Also Netflix fails to acknowledge a foreign movie Those two points are huge in determining at a glance Other then those two issues Netflix is 5 üåü or 5 üëçüèª But those 2 issues puts Netflix in la-la-Land Somewhere between üëçüèªüëé or üëéüëç Please give us back a true rating ability And nationality of movie
"What's up with the new download? It constantly goes back to the beginning of the video. Other's are also noticing this, please fix this."
I hope more movies and series to come and the disney movies please. sometimes the search bar won't respond when i clicked it :<
"Whenever I watch animes in subtitle, the subtitle are just plain white in some white screen scenes I can't read them atleast it should highlight... Hope it will be looked into at.."
Rotate option should be include since it is tough for me to see it in the restricted landscape mode as phone does not support for rotation of video
It would be better If there was an option to change the colour of subtitles in android phone its difficult to see anime due to bright clothing.
Its the best and i get to watch the movies i want but when i go in i lag when i start watching something but the audio is still going but the video is not so pls can you fix that thank you!
"Good 70% of the time. However often stops working for no reason, resulting in having to uninstall and reinstall"
Need to include IMDb rating. It waste a lot of time to chose what to watch. Prime is easy as IMDb rating is there.
I think you really need to add alot of 90's movies of Hollywood and many regional language movies of India . I love some of your original contents.
"Now when I choose the Original language the option to turn off the subtitles disappears, what if I don't want text when I'm watching a movie?"
Please fix the issues with the app. The app isn't even opening now it's showing app has a bug. It's been 4 days now.
It's lagging alot an it don't want to play anything you can get on it then it backs out an go to the main I'm about to get rid of it I pay quite a bit so I'm not happy
Rarely gets good movies or shows. Too expensive for something that gets old movies and rarely gets updated movies or shows
"The experience is fine except the error the I'm always getting and it kicks me off what I'm watching, please fix this asap!"
"The app is great besides few errors that were solved by research, the only thing I would appreciate is brightness settings because sometimes i cant see anything"
I mean I do love Netflix but the old movies aren't there anymore like the old monster high movies which I adored and even more movies that Netflix took down like the Bratz movie and Mia and me and etc
"The app is fantastic. Works fast and responsive, as for the content, there is plenty to say"
It's nice but it hard to watch sometimes with ppl around so Mabey if it was like watch one and go to a different one if you watch a horror movie then it would be good to go to like big mouth or something ü•∫
Drains the battery even when not using it. Even after a forced stop it keeps coming back on. Given this I uninstalled this app from my tablet.
"If only two-thirds of your offerings were not pure filth and violence, it would be a great entertainment provider.now I find I have to either dislike or literally turn down 3/4 of that which you offer."
I have had this for like 3 years now it's never had a problem but out of the blue the new update wouldnt even let me open the app itself!
I really like this app but I cant even watch stuff anymore. As soon as I pick a show to watch my screen goes black then closes back to the home page.
"For 3 days now, I have been unable to stream or download movies on this app. No image is available for any movie or show. Please help"
Good app but the subtitles is killing me i cant read it well when it has a white background. Please bring back the old one
Great application except i find the volume very quiet no matter which device i try use ... its a pity that netflix cant utilize a vlc type sound booster in the app.
Great. Except you cant use the app to change viewing quality. You need to go login to your profile on the website...
What we lack is that over the world we pay for the same price So why american have more series and movies than people from other country Time to hype the game and give us what we deserve or make it cheaper because we lack movies and series Pissed off by this attitude from the developers
I cannot open the Netflix app for the past few days. It gets stuck on the Netflix Logo Screen. Please look into it.
I hope the data usage will not consume bigger :((( but its take so much bigger :(( if you would fix this I would be happy to watch it 10 hours everyday straight.
"Heavy streaming issues. YouTube plays smoothly. But many times, Netflix doesn't even start"
It's a good app but all the shows and movies are boring and once I find and good show like I am not okay with this or Sabrina then netflix has to cancel it I would suggest this app if u wanna watch dumb shows
I can hardly find the movies I want to see really.. n maximum times it shows server down.. I m tired of reinstalling it again and again. Do something abt it plz
"I can't download any shows, I keep getting a message telling me there are too many downloads on this device and there aren't any downloads on thus device."
"i personally love this app, so I wanted to install it on my Xiaomi mi 3s, but it showed options to log in, like (my email) and (my phone number) so I selected my email and it crashed :( please help)"
"Showing only about the app and not the service: it desperately needs a way to turn off the annoying and pointless ""fast laughs""."
"I was in the middle of watching a series, and they got rid of it so now I can't continue to watch it, which is really annoying. But overall the app is brilliant!"
"After the update, we cant open the app on my phone. It says ""we cant reach netflix service right now"" been like this for 2 days now.. pls help."
Dvds give a better variety that includes old series and movies. Tired of having to rent or buy movies when streaming.
Its good but I hate how you have to pay because there just movies but other than that it takes like all day to just update and it is blurry and like fuzzy when I watch movies.
"The app is glitching too much, the whole screen gets green and my phone also is slowing down because of that..please fix it"
I would give it 5 if it allowed you to watch the shows you want in the us like Friday the 13th or Rick and Morty and alot more but you have to go through a pain staking process of using a VPN and changing your country and if you use mobile data that's out of the question like c'mon Netflix
i find it is the best in India. But you don't give us the movies and TV shows you give in the steates. we are second rate clients for you.
"Tbh it's a good app. But the fact that i have very boring shows, plus my siblings accounts have way better shows. Hope you can update it!:)"
App is looping in to advise it needs updates and updates are not getting downloaded.. Never experienced this with any other app before. Expect better behavior from this app.
Some series I've started watching or were at least half through got suddenly deleted out of my watchlist and I can't find them in the search box at all...
So this is A Cool One But.. My living room TV doesn't support Netflix even a update so it's classpro from. Saudi Arabia I have but doesn't work I did so many things I did but doesn't work
"The only thing that I don't like is how they are constantly taking off the shows I watch, and then a few months later they bring it back, only to take it away again after I start watching it again, it's stupid."
After the lastest update there has been some serious bugs 10 sec skip pauses the video with audio still running in background
the only reason im giving netflix a 3 is becuase netflix needs to update its movies becuase there is no new movies i can watch ive watched all of the romance and horror movies and nothing else intrestes me so overall netflix is bom
I love the content it's all good but I'm have difficulty I updated the app and now it is saying cant connect to netflix error 1026
"Lets say a series releases a new season it takes netflix a YEAR to get that season on its platform, and it seems like they arent adding anything new tbh 5.4.20 i can now npt watch anyhing because apparently everything on netflix is not suitable for streaming.. Are you taking the piss???"
"After the new update, the Chromecast cast button is OVERLAPPING on top of the STOP button in Android. This needs to be fixed soon."
Netflix takes off good shows and movies to put on not so good ones. Some of the shows don't EVEN HAVE ALL OF THE SEASONS.
People all over the world pay almost same subscription fee as USA then why subscribers could not find film that netflix have Just for 'region regulations'. That's why people feel less interest to buy subscription
"I dont know why I cant not watch free netflix in the Android 5, or even that in some Oppo phone, I still can't watch the free version. I am a bit angry about this"
With the latest update the so is automatically increasing my brightness to the max in the home screen even though I have set the brightness to let and is not on auto mode
Current app breaking bug where no matter what profile I select it defaults to the same profile. It indicates its on the selected profile but the content reflects another.
"It's a nice app, but add popular anime and add all seasons to each anime on here, also plz add dubbed mha and add demon slayer and Aot and all anime be dubbed and please add every movie/series when it just came out and be able to Change the quality!"
The content is great but you can only pay through debit card which most ppl don't have you should add netbanking or pay through wallet. Please Netflix India add this option. I eagerly want take the subscription
"It keeps crashing misuse. Then you have a hard time watching anything else, the downloads."
"Why I have a problem to play my downloaded drama? It keeps buffering and loading for minutes, even after restarting my phone, the problem didn't resolved."
Very good and great for regular tv shows and movies. Now animae your better off looking some where else.
i had the app but one day i open it and it says i have to login and i trted 100 times and im being serious it wouldnt let me go back in now i can watch netflix any more it ia a good app but if you can help me fix my netflix then thank you
For some reasons I cant connect to netflix. Few days ago it was fine. But now i cant connect at all. Please fix it
I'm unable to intstall this app after i have tried to update it.which I couldn't and have uninstalled now it keeps hanging and i have notification to try later..it was unable to be installed
I rated a 3 but I think it should put I carly back on because u was like 6 when they took it off and I was crying but overall pretty good maybe a bit of work and it would be great
"Expensive for what it offers, other platforms offer more for the price. But saying that they have few exceptions."
"Would be better if some shows wouldn't be region locked for Eastern Europe :( I dont mind watching Fairy Tail without subtitles, I understand some japanese...or Avatar the last airbender and some other shows...I pay 10‚Ç¨/month to not have access to some things because...??"
PiP not working on Android 8.1 phone. Don't think it's a problem with my phone as PiP works with other apps. Have checked permissions etc.
Unfortunately the availability of movies is not such a collection. It's a shame paying to watch only what they want. Soon my membership will be over.
"I love this app, but I haven't been able to use it the last several days. Keep getting an error notice that the service can't be reached. Disappointing."
I give it a 3 star because every time I want to watch a show the video stops but the audio kept going but everything else works fine.
"There are times i can not download a movie. Always said. "" this title cannot be download....."" so annoying and frustrated. Fix this."
Kind of small variation but its not a big problem for me beacuse i only watch a few shows on it from time to time. Id love if yall brought Pretty little liars on or the full of Lucifer on Netflix UK tho.
I love Netflix's movies and series but recently It keeps throwing an error and the app buffers.
"i love netflix, but for the last month or so i havent been able to get past the Netflix name when starting the app. PLEASE fix."
This is a really good show but one thing that makes me put 3 stars is because they remove alot of good shows for these trashy shows and it makes me mad that Netflix got rid of them.
Why is info about Whats new only bull? I would really like to know whays new. Maybe you consider to make a browsable cataloug that dont repeat films/shows again and again. I think you try to make cataloug bigger (much) than it is. It is joust irritaiting.
"Lots of movies available, but you can never find the right one. You can almost guarantee not able to find a complete trilogy here."
"Yesterday i looked for ""call me by your name"" , the app told me that film not supported in your country. WHY?! Netflix is netflix, is this matters where this isüò¢But another parts are good. Thanks))"
"If there is a Netflix engineer reading this, please know that the giant ""Play Something"" button covers the play button when casting and is pretty annoying."
There's this glitch where it kicks me out of what I'm watching and says me to the menu of the show I will happily get five stars once it's fixed and it has been extremely annoying
This would definitely have 5 stars if there were more anime and to include ALL the seasons of the animes provided...otherwise its a great app!!!
This ne update is ruining everything.app crashes alot and when ever i go out from app and try too play a episode it automatically change... Plzzz fix this
Seems to have a lot of content when you are subscribed. But loses all its charisma as soon as subscription is taken
I like it but I purchased premium but I can't view some seasons of some shows like flash season 6 but you can view it in Canada I think it should be available to all users
There are still alot of shows that are not available on netflix India but overall its a nice app to pass the time.
"Slick app but poor content. Great if you want to watch degenerate drag kids but for quality arthouse films or anything intellectual, you can forget it. Netflix is the blue pill in TV form."
Was all good until I upgraded to Android 9. All downloaded movies can't be watched any more. Look like I have to download them again.
"Must update so many times. When I want to use it to watch the downloded videos and I did not know must update, I cannot watch until I reach home to update it."
Please Netflix add walking dead series in hindi language I really need to watch walking dead series if you not do in hindi mode then I leave Netflix app thanks.again I request you please update walking dead series in Hindi language
If Netflix programmers are reading this then netflix is broken I use a Samsung Galaxy s8 when going back to a show it gitches out and lacks weird pls fix soon
This app some major issue which I am facing recently .My phone got hanged when I opening the app and right now my internet speed 25 Mbps but the app no video is working .please rectify the issue
Need to have more updated movies. But also the older one are good. But just need to see and be refreshed from time to time.
"Mostly good. Expecting improvent for VR. Can be very good if VR experience virtually in a cinema saloon. I have an app like this , plays mp4 in virtual cinema."
Needs updated content and if someone hits no subscribe by accident 2 days after paying shouldn't have to repay and price is really expensive went from 8.99 cad to 21.99 cad for four ppl in my house me and my 3 Sons I don't think I like Netflix anymore go with Roku and Disney hell of a lot cheaper and get ur bang 4 ur $...
"Why don't it have russian subtitles? Or irish subtitles? Please add both languages, please. Ye may as well delete the Ukrainian language they will be all dead soon."
It was a 5 star at first I've used this for many many years but lately it was been very glitchy and slow and it's not my internet because it is doing this everywhere.
Sometimes the Video leg behind . . And sometimes out of no where the Video stops why so ?? ... It is now really irritating dude ... Tell me the problem
I am giving this 3 stars because I can download the movie but can't share or transfer to laptop. So I suggest that please available the option of transpiring the download movies in laptop. Because I won't to take the full year membership of netflix?
Good application but can improve more wjtg regards to videos by giving an option to remove videos previously watched or left in between.
It would be better if they offer lots of assortments movies and series like that of the other countries.
I wirelessly stream my android to the TV. When I do this Netflix rarely works properly.
Its amazing but I just don't get why they keep asking down child hood shows like criminal minds me and my dad always use to watch it together and Netflix is the only way I can watch it so plz don't take it down
Whenever I watch a series the screen gets stuck and the audio continues. Why is that happening? Please do something!
Really love this app but the are a few things i don't. For example some are not showing like vampire daries but the originals is showing and they are written by the same author
"I'm facing an issue.when I'm trying to login, the app closes automatically!can't open in my phone for more than a month."
"Netflix is really nice, but if you have it on a TV it only shows you about, but on a laptop it kinda shows the trailer and not about, so......."
"Keeps freezing after I turn my TV off and is showing the app in my notifications, have to continuely force close app"
Its good but right now i can't rate it higher because there was an issue on servers that takes so long to load it pissed me sometimes but other than that its good.
What's with the download speed now.....not even hitting 100kbps. My internet reaches 6-9MBps when downloading from chrome or anywhere else Fix it please!
"Why do yall keep removing the good movies? Last time I checked in there was jurassic world 1 and 2, httyd 3 and some Godzilla movies now they dissapeared The movies here are so boring that if I want to watch something I'll just re-watch a decent movie that somehow didn't get deleted"
"The app works well, but I am unhappy with the movies selection, I guess I expexted more... But for my region - pretty thin, I must say..."
I like it but there's scary things in here can u make another one called Netflix kids please üôè I'm only 9 and my little brother have to watch scary things I keep having nightmares of wat they watch plus make Netflix kids And ill give u 5 stars or more if I can pls
Netflix has taken a bunch of the older shows off. Missess seasons and episodes. Takes away and raises membership!
Samsung s10+. I see only black screen with sound and subtitles. Started today. Please fix asap.
It will be good to have fun and watch but we need more to like see cuz on other internet they was watching other things but I can't watch so I found that unfair if they can watch so we can but we can't its just saying It don't have but how is the others watch that cartoon or anime
The brightness setting really screwing with my picture quality. That shouldn't be on here. Makes the video quality look bad and dull. Please update this asap
I love Netflix but do not understand why the movies and series have to expire when I used my own data to download them and pay a subscription fee monthly
Kind of disappointed in the service it's not as thrilling as I thought it would be and as my first streaming service it feels like I'm wasting my money the content is subpar.
"Haven't been able to watch anything for a week. Cleared data, reinstalled and its still not working."
Just got the new sony xperia 1 and appears like the app just refuses to install is it me doing something wrong or is it netflix because i have no issues downloading anything else and i have over 100 gb of storage
Why does a streaming service now have games? And why am I forced to have them front and center on my home page? You're going downhill Netflix. Get back on mission.
Netflix is pretty glitchey but overall it is amazing for watching things like shows and movies worldwide so I love it.
"Netflix is good, and i am enjoying the great movies.. BUT latest series Seasons are not there. Please make them available as well."
App is pretty smooth but it should show imdb score or some rating system. It would be much more convenient that way.
Movies category view is most annoying part. Cant scroll down to view list of movies in a specific category. Also please add video playing speed option just like YouTube.
Very costly should lower down the subscription fees but it offers a variety of shows and movies which are very good
I like Netflix but Netflix doesn't help me with my fan edits because of the copyright issues. And Idk what to do if anyone can help me it will be REALLY AMAZING
"I love Netflix, but In the latest versions of the Android app, the option to remove a title from the 'Continue Watching' has disappeared."
I think netflix should add mobile billing feature in netflix bangladesh. Cause most of the people are don't have credit card so that would be better for students
"Annoyed by the constant replacement of good movies or new movies with old movies that I've seen too many times, love the TV shows and the Netflix originals but I'm starting to find Netflix boring"
My subscription is UltraHD but it only streams in SD even when the settings is on high and my phone is capable of playing HD videos
You are Charging almost 500% more then AMAZON but still you wouldn't give us a control to manage the quality of playback.... Get a better developer team or just handover your Platform to AMAZON they will be able to manage it better.
"Screen goes black, has sound,no picture cannot reslove this issue be on and off for months."
You should charge less if u only use so much Netflix a month. Sometimes I watch everything interesting. I won't watch for weeks.
"Netflux on my ohone doesnt stop playingvafter 3/4 episodes. When I fall asleep while netflix is playing, it just continues throughout the whole night üôÅ"
I want to watch more anime video & episode. Please speed up the progress & put in into Netflix as soon as possible the anime that ongoing every weekend .
As much as I love Netflix it is extremely irritating that whether it's on my tablet or a computer or my phone it either will not play what I wanna watch or it horribly lags
"While the Netflix movies and TV shows are well done, In a dozen or more searches I have yet to find any movies I have searched for."
What happened to spotlight? Its saying can't connect to Netflix.. When did it go away or when will it be corrected???
Issues get detected more than often and it runs slow other than that it's OK for what I what I need it to be my notifications won't go away even when I click on them
I'm giving this three stars.due to the fact you have to pay instead of it being possible to use the accounts on the TV I would like if you added that. I'm keeping it a three star for now
The app need more improvement and there are lots of bugs are there like loading issues and crash problems
The app has stopped working since the last 2 days after i renewed my payment.. Only Netlfix is shown on the screen. Please fix the app asap.
It would be nice if there was more things to download. ..movies and tv shows Both current and classic.
Its a great app but when my brother accidently delated it it wont let me log in back to my acct it is saved in my google but whenever i clicked it it wont even let me log in it would just bugged out im kinda disapointed this happend today
I went on to netflix by gogle to see if netflix had it and turns out they do but i cant watch it because it isnt in my area even though i have to pay for netflix in the first place
Please have the option to change bitrate. I have the 4k plan and it doesn't even reach half :/ we have a very good internet connection
ever sense my phone updated everything every episode I watch I have to continually turn off the subtitles even on the movies it's becoming very frustrating
This is a good app but I'm watching haikyu!!üò°üò†ü§¨ And there's only two seasons you need to put more on can you üôèüôèüôèplease put season 3 and 4 if there's a season 5 and put it on please but other than that it's a good app ü•≥ü§§ü§óü§© so I'll give it a 3 for not having haikyu!! Season 3 4 and I do t know but 5 please netflix ü•∫üòüüò´üò≠üò≠üò≠ win you do it I'll give you a 5 stars
I liked Netflix more when I could rate a show instead of just giving a thumbs up or down. My opinions have more dimension than just good or bad.
It's good but you should have every season or part of t.v. shows. I was trying to watch JoJos bizzare adventure but it stops at part 3. Please add more parts.
stupid app's rules like cant watching movies on many devices at the same time or cant download episodes while somebody else has too many things downloaded. i mean thats stupid that everyone on one account is connected
"I'd love it if it allowed me to stream directly from my phone to my Fire stick. For some reason, it just won't connect, although it says it has."
"Realme5s When I open the app and try to signin then it has an error messsage And that error messsage says ""sorry,we could not reach Netflix service .please try again later(-14)"""
Netflix is okay but they need to stop deleting old shows off and keep everything on it cuz some people do like to watch old shows still at they remove like MacGyver so stupid and retarded leave stuff on Netflix once it's posted on Netflix
It's good. It has a lot of films series to watch when you bored but can you please not take away really good films/series and can you add season 2 and 3 of transformers prime please?
Needs new shows and movies tired of watching the same thing every time. And takes too long for new episodes to be on.
Really good app for downloading movies and shows revolution of the app is also very good but the only problem sometimes the movies l want to download just stop and makes me very angry
What happened to the option to speed up to 1.5 speed? When i log in and remember that its no longer there i usually just close out the app again.
I like the app very much but I have been waiting for a show called free rein for more then 4 year for te next season en that disappointing for me but that is it other then that is is a fabulous app
It was good not until I can't screencast anymore because it's all pitch black. Can't enjoy my favorite shows in a bigger screen.
Not really impressed.. The video just stops playing in between and the audio goes on..
I really love this but i want to know if u can put The new Lady bug and cat noir shows on (australia)ü•∫üíçty(hi im back on may 23 i cant rember when ibposted this but there's still no new movies on ladybug and chat noir but yall upload different movies like what The hell?
The content is not as good as it used to be and the price went up for less content and many series never have following season even many years later.
"Hai, I'm newbie using netflix, may I know why when I click play movie appear with no picture only sound available.. what should I do with that problem? Can someone help me?"
Seriously Hulu is better than you guys! They have a better selection of things and they won't take off good shows unlike you guys üôÑ
It is really good however it doesn't feature many of the Indian movies for the Indian people out there and also it doesn't have many Hollywood movies either.
Constant errors saying the service cannot be reached. MOST DAYS I cannot use the app due to this. At this point I'm about to cancel. Why pay for what I cannot use?
"If you want me to update every three days, at least add something worth watching. It is very annoying to look every day and see the same movies over and over."
Cuts out on it's own a lot. When watching on different device and then using app progress not always stored
Since you remove some the contents without notifying it would be appreciated that we are informed regarding the same that it is going to get removed on this particular date and time.
"I love this app, I can watch a bunch of shows as well. But the reason I gave netflix 3 stars is because they took off the office!"
Not bad but the subtitles will not go away no matter how long many times I shut them off. So annoying
"Well it is good to watch older shows or, some shows on tv now. Its very slow to put on new shows!"
I love all the movies and all but i just don't like that there are no longer other payment method like using Gcash or anything. Hope you can consider this tooüôè Thank you and more power!
Netflix is really great but one day I went to watch it when I figured out it undownloded its self? Then when I try to download it it won't let me
The app does not open. I have tried reinstalling it several times but it still does not open. Please suggest me on what should I do.
"Turned off captions should be optional instead, you hear one dialog and see another different sentence its not big issue but is annoying."
Good enough but expensive. Netflix trailers are terrible. I'm missing out on good shows coz the trailers don't gibe you any info about the show
"For some reason I cannot select my SD card as the download location. Whenever I select it, it immediately goes back to internal storage"
i don't have master or visa card. you should add other payment gateways. this is a huge platform users should have other payment methods.
I'm passed to know Netflix is cracking down on password usage. I have kids in college and who are you to tell me I can't let my kids use my account now that their in college. By no means am I paying for 3 netflix accounts. This is absolutely absurd and robbery
I like it but needs to be more updated. There are series and movies that needs to be in platform.
No latest movies and old movies are nowhere to be found. An example xXx the return of Xander cage(2017/18) movie is not there but appears on search
Is it just me or is getting harder to find shows and movies thst you're currently watching? I really don't understand why those aren't front and center.
"Yeah! another probe increase coming! careful you're about to start losing people to Hulu, Pureflix, Disney, and your other competitors. Go high enough and pulled may turn back to television."
Payment process is very hard and takes long time. You need to make it easy and fast. And give us payment options other than bank cards like Google pay.
"Dear team, Please fix the bug!! After the latest update there were some issue!! It's annoying pls look into this and fix as soon as possible!!!"
I cannot watch the movie clearly in my phone because it is dark. The app is controling the light of my phone i cannot adjust it!
The app is not working on my device it's crashing continuously on the sign in page. Kindly look into the matter
I'm having a video problem where the episode freezes on one frame but keeps playing in the background. How do I fix this?
"Netflix help me, for the past two days it has been showing only the Netflix screen, and it wouldn't show anything else but the Netflix symbol screen"
It's a good app its just that we as the costumer should have more choices on what they want to see like I've seen most of the shows and movies and would like to see more.
I hope I can organize my list that would be helpful and also if they can notify us directly in the app if a show will expire.
"Pretty cool. However, if price is increasing... again..... then the limit of devices on screen time should be changed to UNLIMITED‚ÄºÔ∏è"
While watching shows the app is great. Every time I close the app I have to delete and reinstall. What's up with that????
"i love it but it needs to have more options and stop taking down shows already put up. for example, american horror story."
Not so good because they keep deleting movies and more for what? and how people want to watch it?
This app is cool but for some reason a download expires the very same time when finished downloading. Very annoying and a waste of data
The app is alright but these days it keeps telling me there are errors and I have to keep restarting my phone to continue watching.
"3 stars because the audio messes with my soundbar. No other app on my TV does it, only Netflix."
"Hopefully you add a feature where we can see ratings of other users and we can see who produced the films (for non netflix originals, of course)"
"Netflix is a good app to watch and download movies, but however it takes up on your electronic."
"I love it like with all the good films and series but loads of good ones get taken of like spongebob, power rangers Dino power, The lorax even the little rascals and it really bugs me!"
Its a good app. Just don't update regularly. They only have 4 seasons of Chicago Fire. Wonder when i can watch the other 6 seasons.
Nice app but does not support multi window. Can't watch if I need to do something with my phone and someone else is watching the TV.
"It's good thought but..... Its starts auto downloading. It doesnt even ask for my permission, it automatically starts downloading any webseries/movie."
verry good but after downloading some stuff it would buffer every 30 seconds and some times it would buffer indefinitly
I used to really love veing able to multitask while watching a film or tv show on my device but the new update has now removed picture in picture which has now made the app frusturating and I hope it gets brought back in thd future
App gets signed out automatically and all my downloads are lost every 4to5 days span. Why is this issue ? Can't you fix this issue!!!
Netflix.please fix your app because i know my password . it would not let me sign in it always tells me *invalid email or password* just pls fix the app
No doubt documentaries are wonderful but I didn't find new movies here and I also faced one more problem that is audio description there is no more enough urdu or hindi dubbed content
sometimes it stays in netflix starting page itself for quiet long time.... needs reinstall again and again...worst experience
Cannot play movies. Shows error. This has happened after last update only. please do needful. Thank you
would give it 5 but they took away English subtitles option. I need them to better understand what people are saying and to learn new languages. PLEASE FIX.
I love Netflix but since April 4th 2019 update it wont work on my cell anymore. I uninstalled and reinstalled it but still nothing :/
Why are my movies getting deleted without my consent? Honestly if i don't finish a movie it means ill get back to it when am free... only to find its been deleted automatically...its annoying
Netflix is the best video platform and many more movies and series but one problem all series no Hindi language.
"From Past one week Netflix is giving me problems it not loading properly, i tried to uninstall and install this app but still showing se error and its not working"
Your service is okk but some time screen gone dark and it can't be default fix this problem because i want to enjoy more episodes please fix this.
"This app is very good. But, when I try watch something it does not work! Please, fix it up! I wanna study by series. Some days ago it wasn't like that now."
HD streaming not available for all types of android tablet is a major drawback. Please provide HD streaming for all android tablet and phones.
I don't really use this bc I have a tv and I watch Netflix there but when I go on trips I watch a movie on Netflix. They also make good movies on Netflix
I have paid the amount for this month and it is still showing payment due. Is it because of any technical issue due to the reduced man power in Pandemic.
On my device Netflix wasn't working so I decided to delete it then download it back but it is taking forever to finish downloading can someone tell me what to do.
Netflix should keep only one profile as Admin. Important settings should be there for admins and other profiles should have only viewing access.
"Maybe quit it with the ""removing shows based on completion rates"" thing, hm? I like to watch shows at my own pace Also stop screwing over your animation team."
"On the phone, whenever you play a click play it just keeps loading I have tried updating the app deleting it and checking the connection. Pls fix it"
"Draining battery in background, although its ""put to sleep"" and ""deep sleep"" by my Samsung. Stopped using it because of that."
"Good, but could definitely use more access in Australia to content for what you have to pay monthly."
"Great until recently, suddenly I cannot download shows. They let me hit download but whether over WiFi or not they never download a single byte"
"It's great, but I realized that when I was watching yu-gi-ho it was missing the whole second season. I was really dissappointed."
"Showing error while loading, tried updating, reinstalling, but the issue persists. The error code is 1001."
It has been working fine until this moment my downloads are no longer playing so i decided to reinstall and the app has refuse to reinstall am so pissed right now it's just wasting my dataüò°
Nice app but when trying to recharge it asks OTP but directly go back to the prev page once OTP is entered. Some bug issue or fraudster???
Not sure what happend recently but shows will lag every 5 minutes until I touch the screen. Please fix!!
I like it but it doesn't have all episodes of programmes for some like thundermans and Henry danger etc and I can't watch full of it please add more episodes to finish this and also plz add more nickedelonoe and gisneja movies like k.c undercover Maddie and Liv etc it's more for Kirsten ü§î
The app is good but there is a new problem. I'm noticing big stutters in the fps when watching something. Please fix this itv is getting very annoying.
this app is really good coz i get millions of tv series and movies to watch...but it would be better if u can increase ur security coz this app is easily hacked...i've changed password quite often but still hacked...
"Good, but they need to change the movies up more often. I'd like to see more of ""a Haunting"" type shows."
I love netflix but their original show's need up their gang it's horrible acting! The voice over is horrible! I just want to see better acting!
"Update: no change in rating: clearly the development team is listening to consumers and trying to make changes, but wildly missing the mark with every update. Puh puh puh puhlease test this stuff before you implement it to the world."
"The subtitles are only translating english to english, when they speak other language they simply put [speaking in *other language""] bro, translate it then."
"One minute im watching this awesome series and literally later in the day when i want to watch the rest of it, It would say this title is unavailable.... :("
"I don't get why I'm paying so much money if the shows and movies that I want to watch are not available in my country. To top it all, there's no reason as to why they aren't available. (rolls eyes 360¬∞)"
I would give it 5 stars but nextfilx just doesnt stay up to date on shows like teen mom two and shows like it. Maybe its just me but my favorite shows are never up to date.
"It's getting crash, please fix it"
Very few if any up to date movies. Most of the movies being offered are boarding and worthless. In otherwords poor quality movies
I'm having a problem with the app and the problem is that when we try rewind it just stops playing the movie or anything and we have to play it again
"Couldn't make payment at all.. Once I enter in for payment, its returning back to the same page.. Quite annoying. Please fix this."
I love Netflix but the app kinda sucks. Downloaded movies or shows work inconsistently but otherwise I love it.
My screen on my phone is black when I play a show only the subtitles show and I can hear it but the screen is completely black any suggestions?
"Black Screen. I've tried restarting the app and everything, it just won't load my shows."
Doesnt update new seasons from shows that i really enjoy watching for example the curse of oak island is a great show but you only have season three up there wjat happened to seasons 1and 2 why cant you get those seasons and post them on next update please that would be great. Thank you much. Brandon Warren
I hate how they have shows on there and then only have like a couple seasons so I get into the show but can't watch the ending.
"It is good but you should make it available in Urdu language and content which is termed as Hindi language content is not actually Hindi content it is Hindustani language (Urdu, Hindi ) content. Correct it."
it's a great app to have for when Im bored or when Im at work got nothing to do but I think the price is to much for it if they lower the prices it'll be amazing not a 5 star yet
It doesn't have all the seasons of shows for example AOT only has 1 of the 4 seasons and for some reason my phone thinks that nutflix is a phone call and goes black when close to objects
I always loved this app! But the monthly price being raised alot really messed it up. I miss when it was 4.99.
Great app as always. Just have problems every now and then not being able to connect or watch off my phone.
"It's good, but keep freezing and reloading in the middle of the Movie, very Annoying!!!!üò°üò°"
"I love this app but lately this app is giving me a headacheüò´ sometimes it doesn't even open and when it does, it crashes after a few minutes"
this app is so great but really kills my phone and even has a high resource sign on it inmy phone with exclaimation point on it which i don't understand but other than that it's so goodüòä.
"Why does my friends account Netflix Premium already has new updated movies like Godzilla vs Kong and mine does not have? My account is also Netflix Premium. This is unfair, we but not getting same movies."
Sometimes it wants to open...sometimes it doesn't. Judging by other reviews they need to work out some bugs!
I'm kind of pissed that I'm no longer able to use a VPN and get Netflix on my phone I don't know if it's a recent update but it's definitely not that great anymore
"I think this app is amazing but, after watching powerpuff girls, I went in netflix again and I couldn't see it in my ""continue watching for..."" list. I thought that was wierd but, I ignored it. I went to search it but, I could not find it at all. I want to continue watching powerpuff girls."
"Idk why y'all are deciding to raise prices. You guys take off the good movies and shows all the time. That 70s show, Public Enemies and so much more!"
"Netflix is one of the Best App to watch good movies, Now days most of them are not upto the standard ( Most of them are not worth to watch) PLEASE TRY TO MAKE OR BRING GREAT OLD MOVIES,"
"This is regarding my payment methods.Idk if its a rule or what but its a dumb one.I recently moved back to the US but because I created the acct in another country,I was told when tlking to CS that I cant use a diffferent payment method because the account was created somewhere else.So I would need to create a whole new acct b4 I can add the payment method I wanna use.Like seriously?That is smtn that Ive only heard of on your platform and it needs to be updated since you guys been around a while"
"One problem: Black screen when playing Videos while wind down (grayscale), subtitles do work however."
"After latest update, I can't rotate the screen, pause or rewind/forward downloaded content. Please fix!"
When I have selected English language only why are you showing the films and TV shows in foreign languages if you don't have its audio in English please don't show it
"They need to fix their darkness filter, literally I can't see dark scenes. Stuck watching shows on Amazon until they fix."
"Downloaded some episodes of Baki, then while watching Netflix says device error, after opening netflix again, my downloaded episodes is gone,"
This app only works with certain VPN. I don't understand why does it has to be really hard just to watch Netflix originals ?
"I give it a 3 star, because i was watching a show called pretty little liars and right when i was almost finishing the show it just got canceled out of this app and now happens that i have to pay to watch somewhere elseüòïüò§"
"interested to try your service, however only debit/credit card for payment option. Let me know when I can subscribe with google play..."
"Does not allow you to use SD card when downloading movies if you are running Android 13, on Samsung devices. Please fix this."
Please add subtitles size options especially when streaming on TV cause i use my Google chrome but the subtitles are too small to see since i wear glasses to see
we can't see images once connected to smart mirroring.. we can only hear sounds from the movies üòï our tv is devant by the way.
Ur movies so less variable to watch...even other platform when u search movie its shown and its even free or much less pay... Be assure to make sure ur customer pay based on wat they pay...
listen Netflix is a good app but still they take away way too many shows that i love and other people do and it's so disappointing üòî i really wish they added shows back like phineas and ferb and the tinker bell movies and other stuff so please add back these things Netflix üòÅ
It is really good and all but I find that there is much on it that I enjoy watching if you could add a bit more anime like fruit basket I think my like for Netflix would go up a bit
"We need new action movies, this are to old and been watching for a very long time, everything same. Sorry for my English. Best regards."
I love the selection of movies but I miss having a synopsis of the movies. I can no longer tell if something is worth watching. Please bring that back.
I like the app but the only issue I have for mobile is when I go to continue watching it restarts the movie or show I was watching. Doesn't continue.
"The app is awesome just sometimes i have to delete it and install again to watch Riverdale. Also add some more funny shows and movies, White Chick?"
netflix was good for a little while but i did not like it when they removed greys anatomy i really want finish greys but i cant because netflix deleted it and theres no other apps in my country that has greys anatomy
The app works well until the last update. I can't watch any movie since yesterday. Please fix. We are paying for good service.
"Why am i not able to sign in?? When i tap on the account id, it shows 'signing you in' but takes me back to Netflix app instead of signing me in. Please help!!"
It's a great app i love alot of stuff that they have on there i just think (my opinion) that there needs to be less netflix shows/movies and more classics that everyone loves
"Is it just my phone that whenever i try to share my shows on igstory, it becomes blurry? It's been months now. Hopefully it will be fixed."
Its okay. But tell me why it struggle to keep the streamed video on 360p while other site effortlessly can run on 1080p?
Netflix is a great app but in my phone it's does not work and sometimes i can't even open it when it opened the movie not play i don't know what going on but please help
The app is good but most of their series they only post season 1 only or 2 instead of full series so one is left hanging without the rest of the series
"The app itself is fine, but it would be better if it had the same series and movies as America does, and I can't seem to be able to take things out of my list?"
"Since the latest update, the app won't open. And if it does, it still shuts down after a few seconds."
Its a really good app and it has some good movies but I think it should have more interesting movies. I think it should have a bigger variety of things to watch.
It has great shows and all but why does it stop the video while I'm still watching and just go to home? That is annoying for real. Please explain why.
"I pay monthly for netflex and somehow it got taken off my home screen. Ive tried to reinstall several times it gets all the way to install then says can't install , try again, meanwhile I'm useing a whole bunch of data for nothing."
Latest version has placed the Chromecast button over the top of the stop button. What are the app designers thinking of?
I love Netflix but after updating recently it stops playing. Why?? Please fix it . It's really annoying and inconvenient
"Nice and good quality. But could Netflix please upload more movie? Some movie that i searched aren't there, we paying with the premium price then we hope can watch more video also =(. Please upload more video"
i have to log out and log in so the app adds new episodes. If i don't new episodes never appear. And where is ''my list''.
App is fine but please fix the audio with description i know its an option but it always start with it on my end.
It was all good until the recent updates didn't allow brightness level to decrease more. Let it go all the way down please!
App is good. Just wish it would download movies faster over cellular data. Ran a speed test and i am receiving 145mbps download speed but movie just wont download or they take hours
I like Netflix because you can do some fun things not movies when you need to watch some stuff when you don't have a TV around but sometimes takes me places.
"very bad colors in HDR, pink n purple tint, spending 799 RS/ month is not worth, application should have custom settings for display of colors, hue, brightness etc instead depends on TV settings"
Please Improve the Smart Download system. It keeps downloading shows that I've already watched and deleted several times from smart download.
Since last update the app appears to get stuck on the loading screen. Please fix. Thanks
Well there are some pretty good stuff on there but I personally think they should add some more anime on netflix for ppl that live in Ireland lioe I can't find hxh other known as hunter x hunter and there is other anime's i can't get on there 2 like darling in the franxx so ya and there is still more 2 come about more anime's that should be put on there like first of all I need a season 2 of the promised neverland but ya they just need to update ireland with more anime's so I'm kinda sad.üò•
"The only problem I have is, they should update their system to a level where by someone can download movies to the other person without using the person's phone"
"Auto Rotate Issue I'm trying to watch an episode but whenever I open the app, I cannot see it in horizontal screen and it's only working in vertical screen"
Please remove blocked movies from popular searches. It defeats the purpose if the blocked movies appears on my top searches. Thank you.
"would give a five star if the subtitles arent so hard to read, some of the subtitles disappear when some scenes are bright, please fix it"
Please give us a setting where we can change the streaming quality. It's horrible if it's depends on our internet speed
"Whenever I try to return to a movie I haven't finish watching, it has disappeared from my continue watching, this has happened twice"
Upgrade your content. Many old shows aren't available. Suggestions don't match with the queries.
"I'm not so happy on how you removed some movies/TV shows as in kung fu hustle, South Park Etc, it would be a pleasure if u added certain movies and shows back kn Netflix"
"For my device is very unstable , I mean , after 2 weeks of use the application don't respond , and I'm not able to fix it . so this is a big mistake"
"Offline mode is really handy, but the new smart downloads option really drains my battery."
"I don't understand why the movies are not updated I can't find alot of latest movies on the app like Flash is not updated, Teen wolf the movie is not on the app, vampire academy is also not on the app"
I am not being able to watch. It just shows 'Do you want to watch on tv'. Please solve the problem otherwise compensate
"Love netflix,but it can be limiting on downloads and options of movies/tv shows available."
How do I Delete shows or movies that I didn't finish watching from my continue watching because they suck? Other then that most of the shows are getting boring..
I Don't know why but Netflix keeps not releasing New series in their weekly episodes release (Specially in Kdramas and Specially in Netflix in Morocco). So we have to wait until their last ep to be aired and that's annoying.
I live in sa and i only get movies that came out in USA 1 year later and I'm fed up with this almost like we are not important fix you app or im switching to a diffrent app amd i thinck thousamds of ither SA are fed up with this like come on
I like it but it's just that I don't watch it anymore because there ar no Disney Princess movies because you always delete movies. Pls delete childish Disney movies or others and put back disney princess movies.
"Read on the Google news that Netflix has Word of Honor, was happy but I couldn't find it your app. Netflix also doesn't want this drama because of Zhang Zhe Han, right?"
I like Netflix but please bring back the old layout I hate scrolling down just to find some dramas or movie. It older version was better tbh. Please bring it back üò≠
"This would be 5 stars if not for the fact that Netflix FORGETS my place in a show... instead, it takes me to the episode on my PREVIOUS save. Fix please!"
"Ok but a lot of the ""new"" content is basically old stuff they keep rotating. Please mark the repeats as ""repeats"". Your fooling no one. Prolly not gonna matter with the looming war?"
"Really good and amazingly done, provides a great list of things to watch. But please if you want a better rating, add the new demon slayer seasons :3"
HDR not available. Last time I checked Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Lite is supported to have HDR on Netflix but it's not really the case in my phone.
Cvvvflglvercv Bharati and other partners have also said that the u.s. will be the most successful u.s. company since it is now offering the world's first smartphone and its most recent operating loss to China for a while than it has on a new iPhone in a long range in terms that it would not only make a better deal of it with a smartphone or iPhone app for users of all kinds
Only Visa and MasterCard accepted at payment gateway. No option for RuPay cards and google or other wallets. I can afford to pay but still can't. :(
"Every time the app updates or my phone soft wear updates (pixel 5), all my downloaded content becomes corrupt. Worst possible times with no service is when I find out."
I use to be able to download shows and movies but now I can't and my account or any of the other accounts have downloads so their shouldn't be a reason that I cant.
"Please add a new option to change the color of the sub titles, I can barely read the subtitles because it has the same color as the show that I'm watching."
Apl is good on mobile But on androit tv its glitches more than 2 months its anoing and frustration tap to play a movie and its gone to main menu al the times üò≠ü§î Or its the time to move to another provider ?
"Dear netflix, I love your app. I can watch anything I want. But pls add stuff like miraculous tales of ladybug and cat noir season 3 or my little pony friendships is magic season 7. I await your response"
The downloads feature stopped working for some reason. Can you maybe look into that? (update: it fixed itself...)
It was good not the best becuase it did not have many movies or tv shows to watch but at least it was good and it really is a good app but it does not have so much tv shows or movies but it does have my favorite tv show sam and cat i love that show so much it was my favorite show when i was a little girl and I¬¥m still a little girl i am 9 years old and i stil love that tv show since then and i really love this app but i really love disney better im so sorry fan lovers who love netflix sorry .
Netflix was once known for its original programming. Now its beginning to lose its flavor in an effort to push diversity.
The app kicks me out every time I try to sign in and I've restarted my phone and now I'm redownloading the app but if it is on a tv it is pretty good overall
"Its really good I just wish there was so many restrictions on the Caribbean. Ex, I am unable to watch girlfriend, even though its on this app"
I love netflix and so does my family but when I watch a season of an anime in English and then am forced to watch it in japanese I just can't I would rate this higher if the animes would get dubbed
Please add a feature to say i watched(offline or in theater) a tittle so that it won't appear again and again qnd also would improve the suggestion coming up in list
Is this app mad when u type a wrong password they tell u wrong password but when u get the correct password and type it the will tell u that too many login attempts -(59) the next day u try the same thing delete install the same thing why üò†üò†üò°üò°üò°üò†
"I like watching movies and shows. However, it's annoying to be asked after 3 shows if I'm still watching. Get rid of this."
App automatically crashes each time I tried to log in after the payment is done. Waiting for a better update.
The app is very sluggish...the video navigation is very poor....running on OnePlus6t over a 100mbps JioGigafiber...so no hardware or internet issues.
"It's good app for watching series, movies and other stuff, but the subscription cost need to be about 150 rupees ($2 dollars) in India üòá"
"Its good overal, but i think you must consider to put manual toggle to make user switch the video quality in android tv."
There are random frame rate drops. The only way to fix it is to restart the app.
I'm having problem with launching this application from the home screen rather I have to open it via play store every single time.
"Lots of room for improvement, like classics like South Park, and quite limited, so we also use Stan, prime and YTP. Not bad value for money. Not amazing."
"They need to make a setting where you can block entire genres and sub genres, for example, french speaking movies or horror or romantic comedy"
I would appreciate if you Added Attack on titan Because it one of my favorite anime I've saw other videos the has attack on titan On Netflix Can you plz add attack on titan back I just started watching it Yesterday I've done with 10 episode now I just want to see the attack on titan anime on Netflix so it can be full screen And HD I would appreciate
"I actually like it but needs more better movies or shows as well. Also, It isn't letting me download some videos for when im offline"
Would be nice if the contents of netflix malaysia match the netflix USA.. cant watch now tho as everytime i log in it says sorry we could not reach the netflix service.pls try again later.. what does that even mean
"the app is convenient and great when away from home, but isnt always reliable...like today..its telling me cant connect...happens too often !"
'There is a problem playing the video. (5.7)' Need to restart my phone every time Please resolve this bug as soon as possible
It's an amazing app but it keeps cutting off and giving me error messages mid movies which is very annoying.
The Picture in Picture is not working on OnePlus 6T. It was working before. Tried everything.
"its..ok...it doesnt have the movies and things i want to watch such as happy death day and they should also, for definate put on the movies that are in the the cinemas or already have been such as the lion king or shazam ."
I already miss being able to have the option to remove a show from my continue watching. I hate when it stays there after I'm done watching that show
"It keeps on having an ""error"" it hinders me from watching even if it is in downloads. Hope this will be fixed soon"
"At this point, the only reason I still use Netflix is for F is for Family and Stranger Things. There's some good stuff on here, but it's bogged down by the overabundance of crappy content."
"I've had my account hacked twice! I've had to get 2 new debit card in the last 18 months because of this. I just know if this happens again, I'm out for good. ‚úå"
"Please make it easier to pay for subscription in Indonesia, such as enabling payment from google play gift card and enabling to purchase netflix gift card in Indonesia."
It goes dark every time I go to full screen on my phone. I can't even adjust the brightness even when it's at maximum in my ohone settings
I'm really really enjoying watching Netflix but I don't know why there's error while playing the videos. Please fix this.
It's ok I mean u pay for it and all but the one piece dub series has been out for a long time or just the series period and u won't post more of them even tho I guarantee you got over 5m people watching it
The app is great. The amount of times Bugsnag tries to track through it isn't.
I don't have enough phone storage for this app but Neflix won't allow me to watch on a browser instead. Is there an actual reason for this other than giving you access to my person info on my phone?
"Pretty good content. Original series are the best feature, and the primary value, of the app."
Always freezing and crashing. Can't play a full movie or episode continuously.
In my opinion it needs a better variety of movies. Every time I search a movie we want to watch they dont have it.
"Getting error ""Downloads on too many devices, Try removing downloads from this device.(NQL.23000)"" for every content. Device: Oneplus 6 Android 10"
Good app but it crashes intermittently. I had to Uninstall and install it a couple of times
What is the wrong with the latest update....it's not working properly...it's just loading and loading and loading....it's like never gonna start the video...
"Basically ok, but a lack of playback speed control makes me use browser mostly what is pain on Android tv."
The thing I dont like is when u take good off for example Reverant starring Leonardo DiCaprio it is not on it no more I really like that movie can you please put it back on thank you when it is put back on my rating will change from 3 stars to 5
"Good app, love the service. Fact that it can't split screen is ridiculous though."
Too many options listed for me that am not interested. Not interested in vampires or demons or anima stuff. Have a rather old fashion taste in movies.
May I know why they are getting The Vampires Diaries out of Netflix on 14th December in Roumania? Because I haven't finished it yet. I just have to skip 2 whole seasons to finish it in time
This app is great I love it. But I was busy watching The Vampire Diaries and then the next day it just disappeared from Netflix??? How does that work?!
Looking through the reviews I see alot of people have them same problem as I have just found out I can not cast Netflix to my TV??? It sucks looks like there was an update?? Terrible
"I like Netflix, but there is limited anime and some of them aren't even English dubb. I wanna watch anime but there is limitation. Please solve my problem."
"There has been an ""error adding to my list"" for a while.  It happens to android and PC, at least. Please fix it."
I have a problem with my Netflix. I'm using an old samsung galaxy 5. And everytime I click a video it logs it me out please fix this.
"Eh, It could've been better but I can't say it's bad. I is a bit annoying for the T.V. display function does not work."
"I like it but you should do away with upgrades,, it bothers me a lot when I want to watch a movie and I'm told ""upgrade required"""
Downloading is very slow it requires high data but Amazon prime downloading option is best and it take less data
It's ok I wish it had more of the recently released and that it was free I have to pay money for it to download movies and shows other than that everything else is good.
Well I dont like that they get rid of some tv shows like Shark Boy and Lava girl. But I do like that the shows are great and put more episodes for the Big show
"Overall its the best app for online movies etc no doubt, but we can't pay if we don't have and master card , we need an other option, like we can pay monthly from easypaisa or jazzcash . Please do something about payment method."
I love to watch most of the Netflix series but instead of getting subscription done for every month I would like to have yearly Netflix subscription in India
"Nowadays, it always notifies system cannot be reached.. and always signing me off. So now I had to uninstall and reinstall again"
The app is great but Netflix India doesn't have good English movies and that's the only problem I personally have with it
I love netflix but i don't like that it makes good shows for 6-8 years then stop. That's not going to cut it.
There is issue with drop nodge display. Status bar does not works after closing Netflix.
The new update launched in April 2023 makes navigating and casting more complicated. The previous version was much easier to operate
Lots of shows but not many full anime series. There is only 1 season on Netflix so it is difficult to find the rest of the anime
When to Google Chromecast it..se have an option for 30sec backward but no option to forward the content..pls add
Its is fun and nice but they need more options in the anime department and in other departments.
I would have put in 5 stars but I was disappointed that crimnal minds didn't have the last 3 seasons and my family and friends were looking forward to finsh the show they should really add the last 3 seasons
For some reason when I play a movie or serie the screen freezes and I only can watch a image with sound and captions.
"The app itself is great along with the content and features, but this brightness thing has to go. Haha. It is TOO DARK."
There is no option for trailer please add it so that before watching the whole movie we can get some idea about it and able to decide whether this movie suits our interest or not.
Great app I've had for a while the reason it's not 5 Stars is because I paid for it and now it's saying it doesn't recognize my email when I try to log in so I can't use the app please fix this and I'll give it 5 stars
"Good but, no full screen option. There's always a black margin. I'm using samsung a70"
I love netflix but i have to pay to get the membership and I have to pay for it more then once but other then that it is a really great app
Add a search with language filter to search out dubbed languages. It's a huge help to search them.
"Good Netflix I enjoy with this social media. Sometimes it's really good to watch the documentary, series, episode etc when it get boredom time's"
Price raised & good movies take down. If they have part 1 dont have the second. Getting expensive and good movies missing.
I love Netflix. Sometimes when I look a TV show it shows that there are more seasons than Netflix showsüò≠.
Unable to connect my panasonic led tv and there is no available netflix app in my tv and unable to view screen mirror option also pls suggest how could i watch the movie in to my tv...
Netflix it's a good app but some old movies don't be there but some do like hunter house and some of the kid movies are boring but this is a go apple if u want to watch tv on the gooood
They have some good apps but not too much of what I'm looking for they had a more selection of app I would like to have on my phone I think I would like it better than tubi
"Loved this app,but there is a problem over sometimes it shows you error in playing the video, I'm annoyed with this ...please fix this"
It would be much appreciated if a flashing lights warning would be added to movies with flashing lights that is clear to see before the movie starts
Mine won't work. It keeps saying that it can't connect. I tried uninstalling it and restarting it. It just won't work.
"Add more options for payment method especially in Indonesia. I have credit/debit card, but idk for some reason my card always declined yeah i'm pretty sure that i have sufficient money in my bank account and i'm already contact my bank institutions and they said totally fine nothing problem"
Update broke it. Keeps kicking me out and cant even skip intros or it freezes.
I have many reasons to give this 3‚ú® Because i was watching my anime then everything turned black i can hear what tey were saying and the sub but nothing just black also it has not updated?! Hm pls update it!!!
"The app overall is great, the shows on it are borderline average and most are straight up BAD."
I was scrolling episode synopses and the app decided to change me to the show I was reading about in the middle of the show I was watching. Uncool.
Top streaming quality but with majoroty of poor content. Lately price was subject to important increase and standard plan is becoming even more limited in functions.
Great App but shows keep rsndomly disappearing and not showing up when I search them but they are srill there on my pc and or smart tv
Software keeps dropping the chromecast connection and icon from phone. Cant reconnect and have to reboot or re install

"I had initially cancelled my membership, but when the App updated automatically, the membership was renewed without my consent today 13/7/2020. Pissed off indeed!! üôÑ"
If I keep getting ads I will cancel my subscription n I've had this one for years so that would really suck but I I pay for no ads so why has my phone been playing ads while I watch???
Make visual some more great.give stretch screen besides cutting 20 percent display by zooming double. Please provide stretch screen view on android and ipad also. Then you will deserve 5‚≠ês
I love Netflix so downloading on my phone I always watch it on my TV it's because I put two stars because it's not as interesting as YouTube so yeah but still good so I want to give it 3
it keeps saying that our 2 screen limit is up but the streaming stick is not on downstairs!!
"After reinstalling it everything was fine but as of a week ago literally every show said ""this is not available for instant streaming"" until I reinstalled."
"Was working fine, lately getting errors the whole time, so I un installed program but can't find it again on TV box play store"
Love the app but it should have more selection and bring back older shows that were once available
I'm unable to open the app after clicking the icon i have to wait 1-2 mints then it says unable to connect the Netflix service
hooooooot but showbox is better because you dont have to pay for anything it's free and you have to pay Netflix a lot of money
I love this app however I think they need to update the steam system there is just two season of the challenge on Netflix they put rest them on there been want watch them all over
"There are things that I love about Netflix, but since the last update it drains the battery on my Android tablet."
The product is payed for but they proctor the times you can watch a given show??? if you like a certain show why are you punished for especially if there are going to be new episodes???
"It's Netflix, they have wonderful show and an easy way to put a child only mode on there so ur little ones stay a ok"
Netflix I really don't like that you don't add all the seasons to all anime show. Please add of them so I can watch them in peace
Before this i download movie easily.. now there was some error showed DLST.N141.. and the worst part is i don't know what is the problem.. try to search online there was no solution about it..
"until yesterday I've never had a problem but I installed an update now I keep getting an error msg that says ""...cannot reach the Netflix service..."""
I have it on my 2019 Acer chromebook but anytime I try to launch Netflix it says it needs to be restarted so I restarted the Chromebook and Netflix im reinstalling it now
The app right now keeps closing itself and backing me out of the movie I'm watching or show don't know what you guys did with your update but you need to fix it
Its awesome !!! Only problem is it keeps stopping an then i have to delete and download over and over again
App seems to work fine but registers as incompatible with OOS 9.0.7 and 9.0.11 so it can't be downloaded from the Play Store
Hi..lately i cannot watch on my phone..it seems ok on my smart tv..ive unistalled it and clear all that could be clear..still not working on my phone..
"Hey, the last update made it stutter. It's freezed every 10 second. Fix it, please!"
I love Netflix but i hate it when i am in a middle of a show and a ad pops up what's up with that it just started happening and I don't like it
"This app is ok, just wish there was more shows and movies to watch. The selection isn't very good"
Need to really lower the prices as they are too high for the Indian market ..overall it's the best OTT service ive every paid for till yet best collection of shows and movies
This app is garbage üò° I can't even watch part 2 of my favorite series . But on HBO I can find everything please give us what we want.
"It used to be a wonderful app to watch my favorite shows on, but after the newest update, it no longer works."
"I really don't like this last update it was a 5 star til then, I miss when I would search and get genes instead of more suggest. You do that on the home page I dont need it there too. Sigh."
I find it super annoying that it seems nexflix never has the 1st movie in a series. For example they dont have bad boys 1 or shrek 1.
Please give playback speed options like 1.25 1.5x just like YouTube does. Infact on your web browser site the playback speed option is available thrn why not on the app just like YouTube?
I really like Netflix and all but the thing is I wish they had better shows and movies cuz I feel like these days don't really have a lot of good movies or shows.
The ratings are absolutely awful! It's hard to know if it's appropriate to watch or not because the ratings are so unreliable!

Content is good. But app experience and troubleshooting guides are not at all helpful.
"After the latest update, the sound quality went way bad. Sounds like everyone's voices are coming from an empty hall???"
I dont like that the app controls my screen brightness. And you cant turn off that setting.

I have a great experience with netflix but it doesn't have the rise of gru movie pls put the movie on the app. I payed for this
Programms are good but why so many shows that are world level available that you are not showing in India? Dont become bias towards us.
"I hv try to restart and reinstall for serval time but it still says ""502-1019"" , is there any idea? Hope you can help me to solved this issues, Thank you. I'm using Wiko Robby phone."

"Non c'√® the vampire diaries, the originals e Legacies. Potreste metterli anche su Netflix italia? There isn't the vampire diaries, the originals and Legacies. Could you also put them on Netflix Italy?"

it pauses on people and it can skip the best part on one of the scenes.
but you need to have things like empire and I need to have scary movies and need to have stuff like on regular TV like adventures and things like movies like parent trap like my girl and things like that but you rich the movie because that what it's all about cuz that's what we love and this what Netflix is supposed to be about when you explained it I only go on Netflix stranger things and black lightning that's one thing that I like and maybe flash but all the time and I want to watch empirehulu
My app has stopped working. I would really appreciate if it is fixed as soon as possible. overall this app is great.
"Can you bros please pay for some better voice actors, this is ridiculous."
"Stop with the, ""Are you still watching""! It's really annoying when I'm watching a series! Just play the series through!"
I actually love this app so much and would give it 5 stars but I'm kinda salty about the fact that sone of my favourite shows aren't available in my region or only a few seasons are
"Smaller selection than I remember having in the past, with fewer seasons/episodes per selection."
"Netflix I know my opinion do matter so I rather not say anything... The app is nice tho, I always feel some kind comfortable while watching on Netflix."
Not enough new TV show and movies. Streaming takes forever. Poor picture quality.
Netflix is lacking support for 21:9 screens like Motorola One Action I use. Video playback never fits the screen
hai may i know anybody knows about supernatural tv shows is it not available on neflix..i search on it but..its break my heart...this apps is awesome but please can you put the supernatural shows..from season 1until season 14...
I love Netflix i mean who doesn't but I have to Uninstall it every month because there's something wrong with it and it gets really annoying
I want to give this apps five star but this apps must buy to watch the story that's why i give three stars. I want to give five stars because this apps have much story and subtitles with differents language
This app and content is very good. But of the problems for language that movie or anime not have our language please update this
"App is good but the problem is, if you are launching your app in INDIA people like to watch movies in hindi and there is limited options to watch hindi dubbed movies and shows. My Mom and Mom-in-low and grand parents facing this problem daily..."
"cast is buggy, no option to forward, so removing two stars. Definately i need to be able to forward"
Video playback on the Galaxy S10+ is low res and looks bad. Why even add HDR support on the app if the video quality looks bad
Love the app BUT wish they would renew the good series faster _nd stop getting rid of all the good ones...whats the point in us rating shows if they don't care?
Its an awsome app! Wish it had more manga series though. Otherwise great for entertainment! And a great family movie night.
"This app usually only show foreign movies mostly, but the problem is i am American and don't know any other language but English!"
Canceling and restarting membership used to be easier as it can be done from the app. Now it's tediously difficult. Why?
Doesnt work on my sons tablet anymore. Just spins or an error message appears when attempting to watch the it force closes
People watch stuff and then you just take it off. I know you put a removal date but that isn't fair. I wanted to finish my show so bad after you took it off that I unsubcribed and looke for it else where.
"Get rid of the games tab. When I open Netflix, I want to watch something, not play a mediocre game."
Netflix currently have some issues when I use my tab to access. I hope you can fix it soon.
"Frequently I get problems playing any title on my android. When everything works, it is really good though."
"I dont like how you have to add your credit card or debit card for you to watch netflix, but i like how you get to watch full movies."
Could update more often and offer newer and older movies more frequently for the cost. Free apps actually offer more and newer stuff to watch..
its incredible [me being sarcastic] netflix hasnt uploaded supernatural so the people that love that show cant see the 14th season of supernatural i love that show please upload it now pronto!!!!!!!!!!!!! and only beacause of that 3 stars dont mess with supernatural.

"I was pretty upset when my favorite show, Naruto, ended and the next season Naruto Shipp≈´den, wasn't on Netflix. Not anything else bad on the app, though."
Netflix you are charging too much of internet while downloading for 128MB you are charging 315MB Have some business ethics while doing a international business.Talking about Netflix we all love it üòçüòç that's y we are giving genuine feedback. thank you
I would appreciate more search filters from netflix. Its a little tiresome to keep scrolling for movies and series you might like

"Halo, I have very often issues. Can you make setting for subtitle? Sometimes I cannot read because subtitle is white and when movie showing white background I cannot read it. Specifically anime"
"Netflix was not used for. 4 months,and you took 2 payments in Sept .I would like to have a refund."
It's fine! The shows and the series! The only thing that bothers me a lot is that in cartoons and kids animations most of them doesn't have GREEK audio sound!! Please fix that! Is not much of an effort to add the Greek translation that already exists.
"You need to improve your memory, it does not matter how much memory I have,you can still block me from downloading more series or movies. Work on this problem"
"Was good but I kept getting hacked through this app, changed passwords and still no change (feels like a security breach)"
Wonderful app. But constantly raising their prices like a gas station. Had to cancel my subscription.
"Add history option so we can see what all we have already seen. Post completing a show, it should disappear from ""my list"""
I dont know why but everytime you get the password wrong and you have to wait on my phone it doesnt reset ever again so I have to uninstall thanks Netflix and android for ruining my day :]
Overall good but why keep putting things on that are old and frankly rubbish. then remove recently added things and keep the bad stuff. Not whatvinpaid up for.
Casting is not working since 5 days through any of my devices on the TV. Casting is working for other apps though.
i love netflix i do but in the mobile app it doesn't remember where I left off it goes back to the 1st episode hope they fix that!
Their quality of TV entertainment isn't as good as it used to be. Switched from Netflix to Disney Plus.
alsome I love Netflix it's easy and has all kinds of shows and movies but why I gave it 3 stars is because the MLP movie is not on there and I really want to see it
"Can't renew expired downloads for some reason, have to delete and re download, shame otherwise does the trick"
This app was great until I could remove videos easily from continue watching. Please sort this issue as soon as possible.
Full screen mode doesn't work and overs the notch.. I am using note 8 pro.. And also doesn't use HD streming
Good. Just have to keep re-downloading the app as there seems to be an error at least once every week
"It is quite good, but there is not much films on it. And they get taken off which sucks too. But overall its a good app!"
Amazing!!!! but not much content as in the united states.. same price.. less quality.
The app overlay isnt working with this current build. I can't use other apps whenever I watch anything. Please fix this.
The subtitles can't see very well because there is no setting to change subtitles background to black
Issue following Nov 20 update on Galaxy S9 plus.... Video playback is dark despite all brightness settings to max. Video is barely visible.
Ever since i upgraded it series dont work and the audio plays and it skips in the audio too and the audio plays on a blank screen
"Can someone please explain to me how I uninstall netflix from my phone please? I have the app on my TV, aswell, but neither fully uninstall the full app"
The video takes forever to load and then I'll have to restart my phone before I can watch a movie. Netflix please do something
"Randomly keeps telling me to log back in every time I try to watch. Ive updated everything uninstallled and reinstalled, its making no sense"
Lacks more shows and couldnt unlock screen lock in android even im clicking the white lock button multiple times.
Need to fix CPU usage when casting. The app should not use upwards of 18% when basically sitting idle.
"It is not up to date. For example the flash has reached season 6, but in Netflix, it reaches season 4. What a rip off ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è"
"Netflix is really good for entertainment, but i don't like the payment system as they don't have upi systems"
There is some issue in playing video. I could her only the audio. So I wish they will help me sort out the problem.
"After latest Update, during streaming automatically paused over and over. Its annoying. Pls help."
"I would have rate it 5 but i have some seasonal movies which are not complete and i want to know when de next seasons wil come(flash,black lighting, supergirl, lucifer and many more)"
"I get most movies, shows, or dramas I am looking for. I am still waiting for ""Cold Case"" to run on Netflix."
Great collections on Movies and Web series. But netflix is way too expensive than other ott platforms
its a good app but sometimes plays with the audio only and not the audio and the picture if that makes sense?
okay i have it on my tv...love it but it would be great if you guys put an asterisk or something to identify a movie is in another language i dont wanna read the movie i wanna watch it... another thing CHANGE IT UP!! why am i paying for the same movies?
I'm in West Africa and instead of Credit cards and stuff like that we usually use Mobile money options for online payments. Can you please add a Mobile money payment option for Netflix users in West Africa???
It's disappointing to see that Netflix India does not have lots of shows and movies that Netflix US does.
Video quality is getting pretty bad...
What happend to theses update? Everytime I try to continued the movie that I left behind.. It won't continue it keeps coming from the beginning...
I would give 4 star if it was easier to change language because another person on my netflix account changed my profile to a foreign language and I can't get it back to English
I've never had a problem with it until now. I've uninstalled it several times and it stillcrashed every time I try to open the app.
Has a lot of good shows and has a variety of family shows/movies. But the price increasing is getting out of hand.
PLEASE. EITHER COMPLTELY REMOVE THE BRIGHTNESS FEATURE/OVERRIDE OR AT LEAST GIVE AN OPTION TO DISABLE IT. IT IS A COMPLETE NET NEGATIVE. ITS ONLY FEATURE IS TO CHANGE BRIGHTNESS WHILE THE VIDEO CONTINUES TO PLAY WHICH GIVES ME ABSOLUTLY NOTHING!
Netflix likes to take off all the good shows that everybody is watching and add crappy stuff nobody watches for more than 5 minutes
"How to cancel the monthly payment? I like your app but I hate your ""authomatic"" debited money in my account without asking to your customer if they will continue their monthly payment."
Are you guys aware the Cast icon now covers the Stop icon when the player is open on a playing title? It's really weird you designed it like that.
"okay app...a bit pricey...shows are okay...just no dragon ball, dragon ball z or dragon ball super series...who cares about the money making part of it just share it all"
"Content is great, but the pricing is too high.. and the plan of Rs199 is just a waste of üí∞ money because the quality is very bad u will obviously regret it.."
"Too many sound problems,cannot contact Netflix,to resolve problems,or issues!"
It is good but it needs voice control for my young kids... But overall it's really good and recommended for decent movies
I like it it's got good shows and movies but I don't like how it keeps taking off twilight and how it's not adding the new seasons to heartland yet.
"Instead of auto skip ending, just put the button there will do. Credits should be played by default."
I love this app actually It's worth to watch but everytime the subscription has ended it pays automatically from my Gcash account without permission if I will subscribe again or not.
Very good app but the shows differing due to country of user is a bad idea since many shows can't be seen for certain people
Slowly enjoy it. With the good selection I funding. Apart tlfir their e-mail say my account cancel cause of card when nothing is wrong. Need to fix that
"Watching Hotel Del Luna, the screen dimension for every other episode is wrong. I've ended up watching those episodes on another streaming service"
"Really good , but there is a problem . Wheres the 4th season of miraculous ladybug, and bring back slugterra and maxsteel."
i am unsure right now what i feel about the app. it always asks me which account to use AND worse is that my list is coming up empty!
netflix is great if you travel or if you stay home you can watch all of your favorite movies/shows at any time i would recomend
It's a amazing app but with the new ad feature i can't watch my favorite show but as long as they make it so I can watch camp cretacous I'm fine
For no reason it freezes. Getting very annoying. It's up to date and everything.
"App is good but today i am experiencing too much delay in starting this app. In fact its not starting and at end it shows ""Device Failure"" error"
Why i am not able to login after i comeback from the app..? It say sorry Netflix service is not available..kindly look into the issue..
"There are many good and decent movies but, the app is the problem there are no manual adjust setting for the resolution"
Its pretty good in general but there are so many series that they dont compete like miraculous ladybug or my little pony and its really annoying.
It's a good app but it's just that shows that I used to watch from my childhood that were once on her aren't anymore first it was bratz and now it's monster high this makes me so angry because everywhere else I'd have to pay to watch it
"This App is a great one, but the main problem is that if you guys put a movie if is not from the Netflix company you will remove it why"
Wonderfully but I would like you to unlock all the movies and series but your services are magnificent but I can't download movies from Netflix plz do something about it
"I still miss some movies and shows.Finally, I'm disappointed that have to wait a year for a new season for some tv shows."
"Works well, but i can't uninstall it? It keeps just removing updates. I want it off my phone to free up space."
well i got the app because it said #1 in free tv but then i had to pay wich made me sad but it was cheap so i got it and then they loccked me out and icouldnt get in so i canceled my subscription but it was fine i guess
"I have a Pixel 3 and it says it's going to be interactive, but this feature is somehow not working."
What is happening with the app... seriously I have tried opening it for two days but nothing tried even uninstall it but still it's not working.kindly fix this coz I have paid
This app is good in all but you really need to show better shows until I pay again cause there's really nothing much on Netflix and I kinda get bored.
I love the experience so far glad for the free plan but a notice on the movies or series to be removed would be better
Since the update the Chromecast button hides the stop button. Not optimal.
"Need to have a way to disable subtitles easily, don't like having to turn them off every time i go to watch a show"
Keep getting a black screen I have TCL phone and my Netflix keeps giving me a black screen but playing what Im watching the app is up to date and is the phone
Freezes a lot if they can figure that out I'm sure itd be a lot better. Wish they had more options like counting on.
"This app so late to waiting the next season, make me to boring to wait, example: Hight scholl DxD and more,I really like netfilx, but why some stories don't have the subtitles we want like Malay, why oh why Netfilx, and another why netflix is ‚Äã‚Äãslow to release the stories we want right, LoL"
I used to be able to cast from my phone to my Chromecast but now the TV emblem is gone and now I can't cast to my tv would like some help to solve this problem
I like this app and it works good just i dont like how after so long it says are you still watching it and your into the movie so you have to stop for a second.
The video quality is so poor even though i have the premium pack and i have choosen for the maximum data to be consumed!
Please solve the issue of casting of Netflix on Mi 4A Pro android smart TV. I m not able to cast even if option is showing for casting.
I had to uninstall and then install 3-4 times in last 6 months as it was crashing continuously.. Otherwise it's good..
Netflix takes to long to update series shows and have up more old movies than new ones good thing the movies don't stick and have some really nice shows
I don't know why but recently my movies aren't clear. I tried changing the quality to high on my downloaded movies but it didn't make a difference.
My phone switches off each time im using Netflix. Not facing this problem while using any other app.
I love all the shows one bad thing they took off friends and the office so that's the reason I don't watch it that much any more so that why I don't watch it anymore that much.
If it's showing a black screen with sounds make sure you turn off color correction and eye comfort
"Streams well. However, any time I try to save a video to my sd card it fails to load giving me error code 4.2"
"Please fix your app, I'm facing problem to play my downloaded videos. If play any download video it show 2.119 error. Kindly fix this everyone Don't have time watch whole day live ."
Anybody has trouble with this app voice sinking or otherwise be certain that it is not protected by app tracking or adblocker and then soft reset phone.
"It's nice,really nice...But why does scarlet heart ryeo not in netflix?It's hard to find a website to watch it.Please add Scarlet Heart in netflix,everyone will like it."
My experience is good but sometimes it gets black while im watching pls fix this netflix and its laggy. Im begging pls fix it
Super sick of having to turn off the mexican subtitles on every episode of every show i watch.. otherwise I'd give it a higher rating
"Wish they would stop taking programs off, very frustrating to go to watch a 6 season program, & it is no longer available"
"The app won't let me log in. I try and after I put in my login information in, it takes me right back to the log in screen."
Since the new update I'm having issues with anything even starting past the loading circle! Really disappointing as I use this app alot üò¢
"You guys need more Classic Monster,Classic Horror,80's Horror.It's all foreign Indonesian,Arab, stuff that has been there for years.It's Haloween Time Hello!"
Why default playback becomes SD quality always??? Coming Soon section must be in ascending date order. Indian movies collection is very poor. Need more regional movies in India specially Bengali movies as there's very limited collection.
It is not getting open in my device till yesterday it used to but after update only 1st page is coming and it stops what to do please tell. Please do something asap.
It would be nice if we sort My list programs as per our choice The weekly episode release dates are given but the time according to time zone would be nice
"Its kinda complete but not complete it lacks more....like part 2 of movies its like a cliffhanger how annoying,also arent there any disney or BL/yaoi series & movies?"
"Just an idea, how about a timer so you set how many episodes you can watch and then it closes on it's own, so one can fall asleep to it"
So many incomplete anime. Netflix. A billion dollar company can give its subscribers complete anime series. Example: One piece.
"keeps kicking me out of the show like at least 20 times while I'm watching a show , and usually I'll have to fast forward back to where I was."
People are saying that Netflix is failing and I am worried that that will happen to me but Netflix is a great app and I watch stuff every day
Good for once every 2 years then 2 years for new series wait time So i just close for two years open for 4 months of nonstop action then close again for two years too reloadü§£ü•Ç Thats worth three stars!
Netflix is okay mobile but then I watch tv they open screen or show video but not start video and not video up and down
"I still love Netflix, but overall I still miss all the movies/series that were removed, like the Pokemon series XYZ and XY were removed."
Eveytime there's an anroid update my netflix downloads wont work. It either gets stuck on loading or gives a 5.3 error code.
I like it but when I wanna watch anime I just dont like the English I would rather watch it in Japanese. And the ads are just ....
Can you please add the option to remove something from the continue watching section again? You had it once and was great. Not sure why you guys removed it.
I really like but when on my phone when i try watching stranger things and other stuff it is real dark i cant fix it like its real good on our tv's but never works on my phone
I love netflix but why am I getting ads like pop up ads on the app now please fix this as it is ruining the experience of watching something
"You can't search by maturity rating. Instead you have to click on a movie, look at the maturity rating, close the movie, click on the next movie, look at the maturity rating, close the movie, click on the next movie, ... Very tedious"
"why couldnt i see the visuals, and please advice me how to fix it. I am very eager to watch some of the series offered."
"Indeed it's a very good appüëçüëçbut some series are not complete. V wars season 2, what is happening, why is it cancelled? Can't something be done? I'm really fed up ü§¶ü§¶"
It's annoying. Logs me out every 10 minutes. I try to log back in and it tells me my password/email is incorrect
"Updated to a new Android, and now I can't watch my Downloads without WiFi when i could before.. technical wasnt able to help at all :/"
Netflix is the best Tv streaming service by far. But that was some weird stuff they pulled with that cuties movie ....
See your app is very good but please try to focus on good content in Hindi dubbed . And mainly we want South movies in Hindi Dubbed.
I would give it a 4 but it dose not really have all the movies that I love and like and so I have to have this and Hulu and the other TV apps
"Hi netflix I liked the app ang I subscriber, but when I am downloading some videos it was downloading at first but if it reaches 75% it slows and the download stop, why is that happening??"
"Since last couple of weeks, first downloaded episode of the season always comes up instead of 'next episode'. Please look into the issue."
"the background of subtitle can it be customizedÔºü the black background block the view, say it can be turn it to grey see though like Disney +"
"but some how now movies can't b downloaded, I have standard plan ,2 smart phn,1 smart TV is included still msg comes upgrade ur plan it's very annoying."
"Keeps bugging out , freezing whilst watching and then crashing. Really needs to be fixed!"
netflix is a good streamer but could keep contract deals with good programs like discover life below zero was great but they do not stream it now.. They could also get more spanish novellas like teresa n lo que vida me robo !
this app is very perfect when you are whatching something but not all people can subscribe to whatch and now specially in lebanon the problem of the banks and the $ so it is not working so actually people are selling the account in high prices for another people just because we are facing a problem with the banks.
I'm currently having issues with trying to view Netflix without an interruption from Google asking me to sign into my account again very frustrating
Why does this app doesn't have split screen option? I would rate 5 if you provide splitscreen option. Thanks!!!
The userbility is not there yet. Its not logical. When i click on a twshow i dont want it to start now but read more about it or get an overview.
"So, the app used to work until i uninstalled it, i want to log in with my account.. And it keeps crashing! What the hell caused this?!"
I guess there should be an option to view or get added a movke of my choice if its missing on netflix..
"The app works well, but the selection of shows/movies is sadly lacking even for popular franchises (Marvel, Blue Bloods, etc)"
Netflix is great but I think YouTube is better because YouTube you can search for any show or movie while netflix is the opposite....
"When I zoom in on the screen, the movie display becomes strange, as there is a black space below the movie"
"basically never allows me to add anything to my watchlist, havent been able to figure out why i constantly get an error message"
app is lagging when i open any preview a while watching preview then i tap on it then app is hanging and i have to force fully closed the app this is hanging each time when i watch any preview.
Something wrong with the App. It's not getting launched on my OnePlus 8 Pro. Neither it's getting uninstalled.
I installed it again and now when I try to enter netflix it says sign in with Google I press okay and instead just crashes no it is not an internet glitch I have 5 bars
The app is alright but I miss watching things like i did with showbox. They also don't have a lot of the old shows
After September update 2022 .. I m not able to open Netflix app after I minimise them.. minimised screen also is invisible.. plse fix this
"My only complain is that a lot of series and movies that don't have reason to be gone . Like, The Pokemon Sun and Moon series."
"I hate having to look up the moves on the web, just to find out what the movies are about. Bring back the info about the moves"
Sorry to say this but everyone one has told me they get a free trial for the first month but they didn't offer me one.that is why I rate the app 3 star because it changed my moods
It's okay I just want it to let you watch minecraft story mode on a Samsung but it let's you watch it on iPhone and I doesn't make any sense because I have a Samsung phone please let it watch this show on any device üì±üòíüò≠
App is well designed but has issues with streaming on pixel 4a using mobile data (LTE) and keeps dropping WiFi connection
"When I first installed it, I signed up but instead. It needed my credit card. I don't use any credit cards. I recommend this to ask if he / she has a credit card or not."
I like it but need to fix a glitch whenever I try to watch a show or something it gets laggy for no reason and doesn't show anything
Hard to watch shows because it's to dark. Can't adjust the brightness because the app blocks it. Kind of stupid!
Good app but recently It won't let me play any shows/movies. Deleting and reinstalling to see if that fixes it.
Can't use the playback feature on my OnePlus 7t and the play menu also doesn't hides itself on tapping.. kindly help
The reviews are gone which was why I used Netflix. Without reviews it is annoyingly unusable. I am now looking for another platform.
Kindly fix the video abruptly stops in between and only audio keeps playing.
Besides the freezing and buffering when watching a series or movie the app is alright.
Takes forever to get new movies and shows. Half the options come from India! Netflix has really gone down hill!
I have one issue my netflix can't watch only can hear sound n can read subtitles only after Update the software
Would get higher rating if the language setting would let get original language as default. Who the hell wants voiceover as an adult???
"This app is very good but there is one problem, which is the fact that they take loads of good shows off e.g. TMNT, Full House"
You know I really liked this app but it deleted one of my favorite shows full house and some of the shows are only shown in the U.S
"It is nice. The only thing I don't like about it is, they don't have movies of all kinds. You have to rent them more often then you can watch them right then and there."
It wont let me pay for my Netflix account. it keeps saying error. even before I put in the code.
Its really good untill you watch many things but my one wish is for one piece to have the subtitles english because is very good and to have more episodes in South Korea
I love this app actually when using the TV to watch a Kdramas but I hope you can lower the price so that we can Enjoy watching.
For some reason the App is getting crash. I couldnt able to open netflix in my mobile.
"Keeps uninstalling itself randomly, sometimes after I've downloaded stuff which is really frustrating and a waste of internet"
It takes more time to load content......it keeps buffering very disappointed.... Kindly look into it....
I love watching web series on netflix but netflix should also support upi payment options.... Can't find any option to use my upi idüëçüëç
"its a great app, and the quality is very good... The only thing i hat e about it is that new movie take too long to be uploaded"
"This app is good no doubt about that, bht day by day its becoming greedy as it has banned password sharing in India"
Application is not loading any of the programs it keeps searching have tried on mobile data and also on wifi and still the same
"Loved netflix before i upgraded to a samsung note 9 and now the only thing i see on netflix is just the show ""loading""."
Netflix is good however I don't like how it stops playing my show after like 3 episodes and it's pretty good but it kind of sucks at the same time
"hey, what happened to the sub? i need a drop shadow effect otherwise i can't see the text in bright scenes!"
I need a better option for quality of video while watching .Amazon prime has better option and youtube has best while Netflix has the worst.
The app does not save the right episode and part whenever I click play for an unfinished series.
Not a great content for the money I pay for it. I guess I am not cut out for Netflix. 2.5 stars. Overall service is good.
"Im subscribe premium plan, but when i watched some movies it wont display on HD means it was set to SD."
The app is great overall its just half of the shows i want to watch are removed and its really annoying.
There should be an option to search for latest and new releases on the app. Sometimes when I look for new movies its hard to find
Even though i am connected to only one device the app still gives nql.23000 error even deleting videos did not help how do i download videos now? Very dissappointed
"Why i am not able to pay for membership i tried with my credit card MasterCard but they are repeating to verify the card , i am requesting to Netflix please fix your bugs"
"It works well and then out of nowhere it will ask for the password again and I'll put it in But it will tell me it's wrong every time , it annoys me very much..."
great content but the app heats up the phone and drains battery too fast compared to other streaming apps
I like the app a lot but why do you give a small storage space and then charge us for money. This issue hurts me every time I think of it.
"I am unable to view my watchlist in full as when i scroll down to view more, it just keeps loading. Kindly look into this issue please"
"At times is very bad, it fails to load even though my browser and other streaming apps like YouTube are working just fine"
It keeps downloading random stuff and I have no Idea what is happening. Pls fix this bug. ü•≤
It has different shows that I love to watch but it doesn't have the movies that I want like the new spiderman.
hii i am not able to watch anything on my phone from past 2 days as the app is not working...kindly resolve the issue or please update app if needed
Locks up and fails to complete downloads often. Some playbacks fail as well.
Stuck at the logo screen.... This problem occurs once in every month.. should be fixed ... Although this is the best app
"Netflix is ok.Not the best streaming software (Lots of reasons, as you can see.) , but it is at least an OK app."
"They took out so many good movies. . Like Casino, and so on. TV shows. And then is not like having Blockbuster."
"netflix is good but to me, theres not much choice, some people like certain types of things that arent on there so the variety isnt great but the quality is good"
Good enough... But I can't watch some shows because there not available for my region.... Why so when I am Paying for it.... All shows must be provided
I love the app but y'all need to update the movies and series bc I fed up of watching the same thing over and over and watch the same thing everyday in quartine
Not working subtitles turn on by them self's everytime I start a program and it keep kicking me back to home screen every 15 20 min
App is gliching and logs me out. I have to uninstall and install to correct it for a short time. Galaxy 8 plus.
Always good to be able to watch movies or have something for the kids to watch it's sad I can't find any Disney movies on netflix though
I would normally give 5stars but the contents are some are too good but some of the movies and series are too boring with a lot of talking and less action
"Normally, I can go to the log in of Netflix when I redownload it but I can't now. its saying ""Error-Unable to reach Netflix (-14)"""
I hope you have prepaid payment option because it's too complicated to purchase an access.
Hi good morning. Just a small issue I can't create a new account everytime I open the app it just go to home. Thank you for your response
"The sad thing is we don't find all tv shows like vikings and blacklist etc they are great and they should be on this app , that what would make netflix the best app ever ...."
Well you do get the movies but things should be optimised this is a premium service at least try to make the ui good and give more features and functionality
Doesn't connect to Chrome Cast anymore and has an unpredictable selection menu that should stay standardized.
"Please improve the kids shows the acting,it can be bad, and the are mostly old movies on .Please get 100 things to do before high school season 2 thank u."
Good app. Wish more old movies were on here. Original productions could use more writing and depth.
Add a easy way to remove shows no longer watching. Allow one user to add reminders to other profiles and add sides to other profiles lists.
This app would've been amazing if only it didn't have a limit for it's overall downloads..otherwise it's a very great application ya'll won't regret installing it
half the time I can't even watch my shows it says title isn't ready plz try later but never works and tries everything on the help page. love the options just wish they mad a new season of iron fist
I used this app for a while but then it suddenly stopped working.I deleted it multiple times and download it bit nothing is happening.
"review 101 :: I had to calm myself down for this so hear me out netflix üòåüî™ #1 DON'T PUT 3 POSTERS FOR THE SAME ANIME AND CONFUSE THE FANS THAT HAVEN'T SEEN THE SERIES if there is one anime ex :: haikyuu, then for love of God put ONE poster or whatever that is and put the seasons there. Don't show 4 seasons separately and let US identify it by the posters...for your context if someone hasn't seen the anime they WON'T KNOW. SO DON'T CONFUSE US :) #2 NAME THE SEASONS PROPERLY #3 PUT COMMENTS"
Upgrade is completely slow I like to watch movies I like Netflix so please pick it up a little bit and let me enjoy it this is crazy it's paid for
After every 3-4 days this app encounters an exceptional error after which it does not app. I have to unninstall the app and install it again to use it
It is outstanding app. But nead to bring 2x playback speed (for PCs also) and also indraduce video quality option.
Everything is good except you offoine download system What the heck is wrong with it man It stops automatically as the screen goes off And its really really poor man Just do somethin about it
Used to be easy to use. Now it acts funny when i get a call. Most importantly where did the casting function disappear to??
Seem like you got to wait for two or three months for the head new movies. It's the same old thing all over again it just like cable.
"It's alright, not excellent but not bad either. I just wish there was a quick way to change resolution in the app itself."
"Its ok but need updating with new stuff more regular, it will have a list of new films/programs when infact they have already been on for a long time,"
Quality of movies/series has gone way down. More of own tv work coming out.dont care for most of them.
Please add support for sliding on the edges to adjust the brightness and Volume. It will make the viewing more comfortable.
Please make all series and movies available in all languages. Atleast my language Telugu. That's all. Otherwise NETFLIX is great
Hello not to be complaining but....... There is kinda a lack of anime series on netflix. I've been waiting for months for new anime but for some reason there is no new anime.
Netlix is the best..idk if it's just me..but when a show get a rating for thumbs down it should disappear in the history..especially in kids profile..so many shows I dont like my niece is watching..it would be 5 stars if this happens
They should add volume rocker on the right side of the player as they added brightness level on the left.
Good clarity and perfect sound experience and a osum application Still two negative area 1 cost is still high 2 not much regional movies or series
from last 2 days app is not working i was watching series suddenly episode stop streaming and now app is not working i had updated the app
"It's a very good app, highly innovative and special but It doesn't show pictures of plasma TV when connected with Google chrome cast............dont just know why"
Subtitles are like chameleons. Most of the time they're blended with the white background. Fix this please
From a Rs. 149 to Rs. 199 to a direct jump of Rs. 499 - that's quite a disparity when it comes to Netflix subscription rate. How about another option of Rs. 299 for the Standard option on a single device?
"It's actually good... The movies that I search is just not there :/ I paid for watching, but there's none of movies that i like :("
I will be watching a show and then all of a sudden I get knocked back to the beginning or knocked back 10 or 15 minutes of show. I have no understanding why this is happening.
I keep finding shows added to my list and / or continue watching that i have never watched or added. No else would have added them
It keeps freezing and always has a blck screen with the audio playing in the back üòë but the app is ok
It really NYC app but the problem is it don't have fast mode like YouTube we can't put speed on video u should have speed mode for video üëç
The streaming keeps stopping and returns to Netflix home page of app after the recent update.
Good app in overall but I will unsubscribe and go to Disney plus . Netflix doesn't have any good shows anymore
"Overall good app, but it is not remembering view progress for most of the shows/episodes."
"For some reason I can't stream in HD on my phone anymore, the site says that my Xiaomi device doesn't support HD. Are you kidding me?"
"Netflix does not all movies we want to watch theres some out ther the Netflix does not have and I really want to watch this movie the greatest show man, but Netflix does not have it so sad and demon slayer new sessions can Netflix pls add new movies and shows pls I'm begging you pls add to add new movies the there not in Netflix like the greatest show man, demon slayer season 3, and more pls add new movies and new shows pls pls pls"
"Three stars because we pay alot of money to subscribe and watch with airtime yet still we don't get to see all movies we need telenovelas like zee world, star life, colors tv,televisa,gma network,abs-cbn and stuffs it must have everything we need"
The picture is getting cut again and again
I have the internet connection working well and I have just updated the app to the newest one but why the app often stops whenever I am watching the movies on my phone?
"As much as I live this app, it keeps stopping SOOOOO MUCH. it is so annoying and I can barely use Netflix now."
I actually like the app but when i open it these days it tells me to choose between my two accounts and when i pick one the app automatically closes itself
the app is a little slow and sometimes buggy but it could be a lot worse. despite the bugs i like it
"After updating my Netflix is not working, it is not allowing me to sign in. Please help fixing the same."
Would be 5 stars but took 2 stars away due to download speed of movies. I can download 5 movies on other platforms for the 1 movie I can download on Netflix.
"As i cannot afford a subscription, i see netflix on mod app,, its netflix mod and nice every movie and series are available,Every Indian people cannot afford a subscription of 199rs, so its good"
Does not translate all talk in movies from Hindi to English. Two people could be having a convo and it will only show one of their words.
Very few Hun dubbed content. Not even the ones which are available on other platforms.
it used to be good until they changed all the movies rating to 18+ some of our parents would not let us watch these shows thus resulting in us deleting the app
It's okey although l do think it needs some improvements. it would be better if each account had it's own password
I'd be giving a better review but I'm I the UK and unfortunately we just dont get the same good shows on our netflix as American users do.
"Can't Sign In. There is no reticle in the center, and I can't just tap on the screen. PLEASE FIX!!!"
One a while the app keep dim the light sown so dark where u cant see. Have to uninstall and reinstall almost every other 3 to 4 days now.
There are anime with only few seasons. It would be better if you give latest eppisode as well whats the point of subscription otherwise.
i love this app however since the new update it stops every few minutes..it says it loading but my show never comes back on unless i exit out of it and go back in..
It's one of my favorite apps ever but they keep taking away great movies and keep leaving stuff that has been there for a long time
Love it but HAVE MORE MOVIES IN SPANISH I DONT ME FROM OTHER COUNTRIES I MEAN USA MOVIES THAT HAVE IT IN SPANISH BECAUSE MY FAMILY LOVES THE MOVIES BUT BE NICE IF WE CAN CHANGE THE LANGUAGE SO THEY CAN UNDERSTAND IT. THEY DONT SPEAK ENGLISH IT VE NICE TO WATCH ONE THEY CAN UNDERSTAND
Having app issues with it not wanting to open. Tried many times to make it open with no success.
"its pretty good, nothing too much going wrong. If the network isn't good, the connection'll be worse. Needs more movies tooü§î"
Its the same movies and shows i get burned put it should be more of a free app if they dont do better we pay but it takes them a year or 2 to get another season im old i could be dead by then
"It was working fine, until few days ago it stopped opening on my phone, I have reinstalled it and still it keeps on loading at start."
"How tf I can adjust the brightness? Whenever I played a movie, the screen automatically turns into full brightness."
"This Netflix app is super cool, super great, Anything that you love to watch you can find it on NETFLIX APP Netflix the better option"
Error 101.8.1 on all downloaded titles. Had to uninstall. Otherwise fantastic.
There ate other apps on playstore that gives more content and they are free.....so please give us more content.....there should also be a division on actor selection
The app is fine but I have been have troubles downloading. I already cleared my storage and updated the app yet I'm still unable to download
It's pretty cool. I love the content that is available so far. There aren't that much technical issues with app as well.
Every time i try to watch anything it freezes its not loading its not buffering it just freezes its sooooo annoying plz fix this
Yaa I have a small issue with downloading I put download all night but the problem is. it will pause automatically so please fix this problem
My list is not working. I can not booked my list. On the screen a sign for check book my list is not working.
"Cant open my netflix apps, keep paying but always stuck on ""netflix"", keep uninstall, install but still same."
I got Netflix 7.99 and suddenly my payments for 19.99... I was not asked for the upgrade. I did not want the upgrade
"netflix is gr8... but it would be better if they added newer stuff. especially anime, and if we're being specific, My hero academia."
It's an amazing app although I'm seeing a lot of bad review due to the updates they had recently hope that whatever they are dealing with gets fixed.
For some reason I cant find my downloaded movies again and there is no download button anymore. I cant even download and even the once have downloaded before I cant find it.
"As of recently I'm unable to watch any videos. Error message (5:8). Tried restarting the phone however, nothing happened."
"This app Not running on my wi-fi connection..it run only on mobile data, and overall it's a excellent appüòâ"
Netflix needs to add more good horror movies as well as other genres. the serials are nice but movies are mehh
Good but there's a bug which makes me need to redownload it since it wont work when I go out of the app for 1 minute. Please fix it.
Fair Everything was great but I cannot screenshot the series that I am watching. Why is that I do not pirate any your shows but atleast give the chance for screenshots.
It's a really nice and useful app but it makes me pay a lot of money and there movies and series I want to watch aren't on the app.
What am I paying for if it won't load the movies? I can't get it to load half of the movies are blank. Every single day it does this.
"Have found this ""Paid"" app to have less and less descent movie's to view anymore. I'm thinking about cancelling my subscription."
It shows the same movies all the time not really good scary movie it shows a lot of the old movies I noticed YouTube has better movies then Netflix
"The new update on the subtitle sucks, its giving us a hard time to read it, please bring back the original!!!"
"In the latest version, streaming speed seems to have been removed. I'd like to have it restored."
80 percent of Thumbnails of all content is neither showing on my one plus 7 phone or my smart tv after the recent update yesterday. Why should I renew it this month end?
It's great tho and I love the new series uploads . But the reason for three stars is that I wasn't able to get what I want from my best series.
Really makes me mad that when I use the app with my laptop and I pause it sends me back to the Title when I'm trying to pause to read a subtle
"I'm happy using this app but i would be also grateful if we had more new Korean Drama.. Like ""The Mermaid Prince"" as it's the only app i can use to watch Kdrama.. Thank you in advance."
"I only use 1 device but now I am trying to download other things and it comes with an error that ""You have downloads on too many devices..."" how can I resolve this?"
"Uninstalled: app is good, but too many notifications each day. Add an opt-out option."
The videos nolonger loading on my tablet.
Netflix should give a feature to mark the series or movie as watched so it won't suggest us that again and again. I want new suggestions not the one I already watched.
"there is no forward button available on chromcast, really not user-friendly when casting on screen.. update with that please"
"Not able to see recent logged in devices in ""manage access and devices"" menu. Please fix this asap."
The app is very good but the movies I love watching is not there and the ones that are there have watched everything please üôè add more royal Korean drama
still sucks a lot of battery even when not being used. usually shows as top user of battery power.
Please give me pokemon journeys and the avengers movies its the reason why I signed up in the first place. I like the series that you provide but my sole motivation why enrolled to Netflix is watch those. I'll give 5 stars if you give me those.
Seems to just play a black screen? On everything. Only started doing this the past week or so. Please fix
it's but but it is also an addictive app a user has to face addiction of this and it consumes too much time and you can't grt rid of it's addiction
Trying to download a show while watching another one but then downloading is paused kindly fix this issue.
"Usually great app but unable to open now, just stuck on netflix screen & won't go any further. please help"
"We pay the money and you give us the movie. Do your job honey cause there ain't no movie in your list that I wanted to watch Make my money worth it. I ain't want you to list the movie and say you don't have it. If u don't then, buy it . But this app is good though."
I love Netflix but there's one problem with my Netflix like there's only 2 seasons for one of my show's im watching and there's supposed to 4 and same thing with my other show there's 4 seasons when there supposed to be 6
Its good to watch my animes but can you guys add my hero academia please and the movies they can be subbed for all i care just do it you could probably get more money from it
"please update the anime in the caribbean region there's barely any anime and most are in Japanese and also put some new movies there to because most of the movies are from a long time ago,the only thing i can get thats updates alot is the cartoons"
This app is a blessing. I love it. Just want volume control on the player like brightness control. Plz add it!
Why doesn't Netflix take advantage of the Black part over notch area on my galaxy note 10+ ? Its just black even when expanding screen (zooming in).
"Really bad , no use of downloading this app for me just because I don't have a visa debit card, need for expanding the payment facilities.hardly disappointed!!!!!"
I love the app but can you please tell me why the American side does not have Naurto Shippuden dubbed on it but Canada does I have really wanted to watch it but I can't and it really upsets me. I don't even think you will see this but if you do please answer
Can we move the suffle button away from the chromecase quick controls? I see them.... But the button sits right on top of them. On Samsung S20FE
Issue in opening the app. I have just made the payment for subscription and now app is not opening at all. Kindly help.
"Netlfix is great, only wish it was cheaper. But yes best place to watch TV shows and all."
Good but every so often show freezes on one frame and I have to go off of the movie or episode and reload the app
This app does what you want however it eats your battery at an alarming rate and is far more energy hungry than any other similar app.
This app is alright. Used to be better. Now There's Not too many good tv shows or movies to choose from. Could be better.
The shows freeze but the dialogue keeps playing. So I can't tell what's happening
"Netflix movie üé¨ library in the uk üá¨üáß, doesn't have a large collection of recent movies, compared to the usa."
"I can not believe that in a country as multicultural as Canada, do not include Spanish in most series that in other countries are :("
always have issue with downloading episodes. I like to download in order to avoid buffering.
Almost half the movies I search for aint available in my region (India) why?! Why can't we have all the damn movies/series that're on Netflix?
"I request Netflix add sort and filter, like other apps, instead of us scrolling like fools for hours... How hard is that."
Okay app but not worth the money anymore. Very disappointed that almost everything to watch is for some reason Spanish now when it never was before.
"I already download the Netflix and when i use it and i use my mother in law account can, and after that when i want to open again till now cannot anymore always error, not good"
Would rate it 5 stars if the in-app brightness changer was removed. It is so unnecessary and temperamental.
whenever i pause the stream and switch back apps the audio from the stream start playing after i play any audios in other apps
"I like war movies, for example, Saving Private Ryan, but Netflix doesn't have as many movies of that style and I would like them to put more."
Can you add 'list of movie that had been watching' by any kinds of your wish? At least we can go back to know our history. Thank you for implemented this suggestion.
"Everything's gay on this app, we Africans don't tolerate such contents. I suggest you change the contents you send to our region else we'll ensure the government put a ban on your app in our country/region. Anyways the app is good except the contents."
after updating app my app has all gone black. despite having quality internet. i cannot use it. when i play anything it says erorr
Downgraded the rating to 3 from a prev 5 star due to the recent on going addition of B rated movies with not much good quality A rated movies being added. Can do better.
It works but sometimes the image gets stuck while sound track and subtitles just keep going
Be better if Netflix put more Qaulity on instead of filling it with rubbish especially with them putting prices up best change or ill cancel my subscription
Its a great app but netflix always freezes at random times and when it resumes the screen is frozen
"Why does it gets stuck when I open it everyday. I have to uninstall it and again reinstall it to make it to work. Then again next day, same thing happens"
"This is a great app I really enjoy using it But no rush, when is all of ""Haikyuu"" seasons Going to be uploaded? I really wish it can be Put up fast (again, no rush) I've been waiting for it a bit Thank you"
"NGL, this is a good app. The problem is why is there a bunch of not completed series. Ya'll really just have season 2"
"Why i have a trouble on downloading and streaming.. it's like i hardly connect to Netflix server, bcause my internet connection is good.."
"netflix is decent, but it has always left something to be desired when it comes to movie and tv show selection..."
"What happened to the casting button? I only see it after selecting a show, which is super annoying!"
"I can't see where I left on Netflix, it stopped showing me how many minutes are still left for my movie. Pls fix this"
I love the app it does glitch a lot through the episodes though but other then that and the sound is really quiet
i can't stream anything on mobile data even though I got LTE+ coverage. it says it has to be at least 3G but LTE+ is more than 4G.
Why the bold type series season 4 is not playing on Netflix. What happened with that. It's showing error with the app.
"I love Netflix, but the movie cuties, is completely disgusting. They are like what 12 and being very inappropriate for kids."
So easy to use! So very perfect!! I love it & I would like to work with it one day on one of my movies!
I wish i could see the ratings of the shows and films on the app itself rather than each time search for it on the web
Really frustrated about the expiring content. I thought I would be able to watch it whenever I wanted.
"It's good, but theres not alot of new stuff on here to watch, always end up watch something that looks like it was made in a basement"
The latest versions of the app drain the device battery even when in browse mode. Please address this issue...
It has been glitching for the past few days and I can't watch it properly. So I am giving Netflix a 3 star rating
Look I love Netflix but I'm from south Africa and its just unfair that I can't watch my favorite shows and movies like my favorite show Riverdale only season 1 and 2 is on my Netflix Its so sadüò•
Ever since last update closed captioning comes on automatically so I have to manually turn it off on every episode and it randomly stops playing
"I want different type of list for different mood. Like move list, web series list, romantic list, action list. Please update. Thanku"
Newer versions use too much resources on my phone. With a snapdragon 820 it uses 35% of cpu while the oldest version uses 12%
The movies is good. but we can't open netflix with Indonesian biggest provider (telkom and telkomsel). i used to use a vpn but now the vpn doesn't work.
been having trouble getting it to open. so for now I'm only rating this 3 stars. hope they fix the problem soon.
"There is no complete ""Divergent"" series, no complete ""Spider-Man"" movies, no ""Harry Potter"". There are just Tv shows. Not movies"
Currently the app doesn't work great it keeps getting out of the watching window when i watch some movie so fix that its annoying
"Suddenly i am not able to download videos on Netflix..it shows ""this title is not available to watch "" how come this happened ?"
Why does my netflix keep on coming out of the screen . I don't know what to do . I love netflix but all if a sudden it started doing this
It's getting to be too expensive. Love the app but it's too much now. I'm debating cancelling my account on Netflix.
Love Netflix but 2 updates ago the chromecast icon was moved to cover the stop button.. very annoying
The app is great. But hate paying every month. Why there is no quater year payment option available for phone?
It's nice but it doesn't show all the seasons of the anime I watch it was supposed to have 9 seasons they only put 4 seasons other than that it's great
Netflix is not working properly it freezes Everytime you want to watch something and also it has been chucking me out of my stuff that I want to watch
It's good streaming but the price keeps going up.. if goes up past 20 dollars for standard I'm cancelling and sticking to Hulu...
It would have been a five star but it consumes too much mobile data subscriptions. That alone discourages me from renewing my sub.
I don't know why the app is automatically closing when I'm trying to open it ! I tried everything but can't resolve this issue ! Please help me !
I don't like the fact that i should wait for a kdrama that already there episodes aires two weeks or more for showing on netflix why in other countries it comes with the timing of the kdrama but here in morroco u have to wait .. i just ended up watching it in other platforms :(
There is a lag in audio. After every 30 minutes or so.. I need to go back and start the video again
I like Netflix but I want more variety of films and series. And I also want latest films or series to come into Netflix quickly
Missing obvious functionality. Why haven't you enabled an option to stop showing things you've watched?
Always bugs out! I have to install and uninstall all the time because it stops working on my smartphone.
Well why doesnt this app have an option for the 4.2 android system? I have a tablet that is locked at 4.2 cant be updated. And i want netflix on it...no can do.
Im facing issues with the new update. I am not able to stream with my friend on the call which I could before. Please fix this ASAP.
it's not showing the shows that I'm searching for. And i want to watch my all favourite great American tv series.
slow when opening the app. keeps crashing. amd so far no update on the app
Not everything is available for downloads it says not available to my country and it keeps changing the available series almost everyday one time u can find it other times u can't
"Please add more control by category words, it will be much better like (violence or nudity or bad language) so we can close by words."
app kinda sucks. have to do a run around of clearing cache & other nonsense to get it to play videos more often that anyone should need.
All good..but i am a little bit disappointed by the mismatched of vocal(Audio) and subtitle...
I really enjoy Netflix. . I m on a fixed income and can't afford it every month.
I love it and all the shows but when me and brother are watching it and my dad wants to as well we have to pay +$4.99/ mouth just for him to watch it to its jus so dumb
"Good, but Netflix needs to make all the movies be available in all regions."
"A bookmark feature or save for later feature, and some sort of rating, Rotten Tomatoes or IMDB please. Iwould five star the app immediately."
It's fine but when I was watching one piece on my google ao3s it keeps diming my screen and when I try to turn the brightness up it won't let me.
I'd put a 5 star rating if you put a option to only watch one episode at a time. I'm tired of waking up and the whole series has played.
Some of my favourite things are not available. Overall great experience with available content.
"I am stuck on the home screen. It says ""Would you like to watch this on TV?"" and there is no Yes or No option. Cant even get into the app please fix this."
"App ok, but want to be able to have English subtitles on all the moves I watch from non-english speaking countries"
I like it overall... but I wish it was easier to pay if you are late in payment... its really a struggle... please take action about this matter thank you...
Search option should be hindi dubbed hollywood or other like Korean Russian etc. This option help Indians to watch other countries movie and web series only dubbed Hindi Audio.
"Everytime i open to watch something that is not Netflix original, my phone restarts and its strating to turn annoying"
"I cant download whatever movie i searched for, there's no download option whenever i search for a movie, except that,it is a good movies downloader."
It is not being open since last 3 days
"I've had this app before but when I just downloaded it, it wouldn't work and I don't know why. other times that I have used it it has worked perfectly fine."
"So, wait. I pay for Netflix but I also gotta pay to watch the good stuff? I can get the shows and movies on a few different websites for free..."
"The app is fine but when I literally have no downloads on any other devices, my phone refuses to download movies because it says have too many downloads on other devices"
Absolutely loved it until now the vampire diaries is being taken off! Can't live without it and I cant get anything else to watch it on!!
"Very bad search functionality When you want to watch some thing, you have to exactly type name and still it's not there Need to improve on that"
The sound is not working and you should even keep some movies or shows for free.
My Netflix lately keeps crashing for some reason .. Great when it's working how it should..
video keeps blacking out but the audio is still running. is anyone else experiencing this? I'm using huawei p30 pro
"Really? No options for resolution? It's a pain trying to watch the same titles over different types of devices, and don't even try to use a VPN!"
You would think after so many years that you would stop asking me if it's me or if I had kids considering they're all adults. That's why you get a three because I am tired of clicking on me after all of these years. You need to work on that considerably considering how much of a delay that is. I just want to watch the damn movie and not identify myself as much as I need to just to watch a damn movie.
I really love watching my favorite shows on here but i really don't like it when shows are removed from there and its kinda disappointing
I cannot remove movies from continue watching list even if i don't want to watch. make sure you rectify it.
Bro why are you taking off all the good shows man...? You guys are taking off one of my favorite shows and it's the Night shift like come on man plz stop taking movies and shows off of Netflix we all watch them
"It's a great app, and I watch my shows on it but like any movie app sometimes it doesn't have what I want but I mostly want to say undo this update it's so bad üíÄ"
"The richest app in world is most buggyiest , developers i think you guyz are nuts,and netflix honestly speaking,you guys care for money only...fix the bug specifically stucking and app closing problem"
I like it but not all shows or movies from around the world are included because of your region so that is the only thing that I don't like about the app
"Give us another payment method like google pay, phone pay, paytm or rupay or paypal!who have not this kind up debit or credit card they cant subscribe netflix !Very disappointment!"
"It was hard for me to put it in, it rejects my card when it has funds, it's fine and it's not expired. I put everything correctly. it's bad for that"
"Netflix has gone downhill quite a bit over the years, and their prices only get higher."
"I'd like if they made an attempt to inform us with changes each update. Comes off as lazy at best, or they're hiding something.."
Netflix is annoying this days I can't screencast my Netflix on my tv again It just showing blank screen with audio
Movies always hangs even downloaded ones. Can't watxh a full series without getting those. Fix it.
This app works brilliant but the only problem is that the movies they put on there are replaced by other movies quite frequently
Too many foreign films and alphabet movies/shows. It does not give the option to block the content for kids.
Loads faster than Disney+. Needs new titles though. Selection is very old and boring
"good app and great customer service but needs more titles, its common knowledge that other countries get more than us for the same price."
Even with all settings set to WiFi it somehow still uses my mobile data. Please add permission requests or warnings when mobile data will be used
"The app works well, but keeps putting icons on my home screen. uninstalling for my sanity's sake."
Suddenly stops at night and don't load any show . Every night it happens and start working next day .
"It is a very much entertaining app, especially when bored. All the series are fascinating and exciting"
What's wrong with the subtitles font size!! It became SO BIG and there's no option to make it smaller!! Why all those absurd updates?!
There is other movies or series you can't find. We need all the series and movies here so we can enjoy and watch it and also rate it
i only rated 3 stars of this app because this apps havent got all the episode of cartoons example: Teenage mutant ninja turtle it only has 2 season and i know that they saw a house and more there should 3-4 season so PLS FIX IT AND PUT MORE SEASON
"Ok cool app and all BUT JUST STOP REMOVING ALL THE GOOD GOOD LIKE ANIME, SERIES, MOVIES, AND ECT. They removed attack on titan and is about to remove Hunter x Hunter so please just stop removing all the good shows. >:("
So many things to watch but I'm frequently having problems with downloads. They should improve this part.
Just like ...we have a option of giving a Like to a specific content Netflix should give us the option of giving a dislike...#ClickBait
"My netflix account keep suspended and keep saying ""there is a problem playing the video..."" This is so disgusting because i paid it every month."
"Can't connect to Netflix services using latest version, downgraded to previous version works"
There should be more and latest movies available for watching. Not all movies are available here as well.
Content are good but need to improve on series of drama. Don't delay the series release.
I have't open this app for nearly a month and now after one month later this isn't working. I have to install this and then install again now hope it will work...
You need to pay. And it takes long to load. Some movie or shows that you know is not there.I hate Netflix need upgrading
needs better horror movies like all of the children of the corn and all of the saw movies. You guys need to put way better horror movies the ones on here arnt even scary.
"Nice app but there is one defect, if they should add(upload) marvel studios all movies in 3 or more languages this app will be super and awesome"
We need more good movies all the movies I already watched and there's only a little selection of new or good movies the rest I don't have interest in.
"It Does Make Me Really Mad Sometimes, But It's A Great Place To Watch I Actually Like It, I Don't Have To Watch Stuff On A Sketchy Website, And Overall Good."
Well it's good but it would be nice for once if you put Audio in spanish for american horror story.
Just great entertainment
I have been facing error (2:001) - video unable to play. Tried rebooting the app. Nothing works.
There is no use for me from the Netflix. The app isn't working properly from the past 2 days I sign up 3days back only
It would be better if it would have had an option to control the video resolution/quality for metered networks.
"The lineup apparently changes day to day. One day I can watch a series, the next day it's gone, but it comes back again."
"This is a fun channel it's called Netflix go check it out right now, anyway I like it I would not say I love it but I like it, you know what it's better than spectrum."
I really liked the sleep timer and it seems to be gone in this version! Please give the timer a second chance :)
"Worked fine for years, now suddenly i cant play anything, uninstalled it to see if that fixed the problem and now it wont reinstall"
There is no forward button while casting to Google Chromecast. Please add forward button during casting.
I very much dislike the direction towards ads on Netflix. I got Netflix because I wanted ad free TV!
I'm starting to hate Netflix bc they're getting rid of amazing series like full house. I want to watch it so bad but I cant watch it anymore
I'm having no problem with the app but I want u guys to add more features whilst watching an a more interactive interface
"Latest update and I can't cast. Won't even see any of my devices, but I can case all of my other streaming apps."
I don't understand it keeps on gliching when I open it does the opening intro and stops there it started happening today and this only this device
"Much movies are not available... like The Vampire Diaries...so, I wish that there should be old movied available at Netflix.. Thankyou"
I love the movies and the things i keanbin Netflix but... Sometimes it do no connection and i get very mad ...üôÑ I hope yall like my expressions thank youüôÑüòë
"The shows are good, video quality also good, but lot of flims are not available both of Hollywood and Bollywood"
"This App is really Good. BUT most of the movies, dramas, web series are not here in Pakistan. Please make those things available in Pakistan."
They keep taking all the good shows away and STILL raising the price. Totally lame. Only here for like 2 shows max.
missing many options 1. Language filter 2. Subtitles position options Issue App show the desire available Language for live stream but doens't support same language in downloads
"Literally at the time of Lock down due to covid 19 Netflix help me to staying in home üòÜüòÜ I am enjoyed lots of series, drama, movie, reality show, and many more Netflix im lovin itüòç"
After the recent update the app keeps crashing... The app keeps turning off itself....
It's a nice app for movies It's just that it involves much of data The videos are of extreme quality
"App is good, and function also good. But content are not sensord so some times anti religion, anti human things also there in collection. Entertanment is ok but bad culture is not acceptable."
"-2 stars for NOT HAVING SCREEN ROTATION IN THE MAIN MENU!! Seriously, get with the program folks. Otherwise, it does what I pay it to do."
I didnt get the free 1 month trial. I paid immediately after subscription and a month later services were suspended until i paid again
Netflix was great until they pushed out the new update and now I can't find what I was previously watching.
It's a go9d app but why some of the series isn't full pls mk it full wires üôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè
"Good app, however I am getting error saying ""you might be using a proxy"" I have no such proxy, and the series I could watch it before"
y'all are just dead wrong for the whole no password sharing thing
Not bad But I don't like the fact that Netflix restarts membership without my consent every month
Was okay but suddenly when I'd open the app it would just freeze at the opening screen.
"It doesn't provide enough shows, my kids love the show K.C Undercover but it's only on Disney+ and Hulu, so my children and I would like to see K.C Undercover, A.N.T Farm ECT. Thank you for you time."
Need fix on back button close app
"Good app, good shows, but i hate it that it doesnt show US shows that are in other countries as well."
I'm supposed to get free from ads and I get them now
I have not finished watching this movie. I will rate as soon as I finish the movie.
I don't like that more and more content on Netflix is in line with LGBTQ Ultra Pro Max Plus thing. We don't have such issues here in India. But this darned Netflix content will definitely have subtle messages regarding LGBTQ --- things Make content that is relevant for Indians And don't try to feed your nonsense cultural concepts down the Indians throat
Too many unnecessary bugs.
"Excuse me? But why does it kept on saying that I have no internet connection when in fact I have a stable signal. I can't use it or even let me switch to accounts. What's wrong? Please get things done, we're paying right. Please."
Please enable HDR support for Nothing phone 2
"I can barely scroll through the movies, it will never let me use the keyboard to see what movies are available."
"its an ok app but you show alot of movies that are so generic & corny. really yall put new movies on please. put new seasons on, take out the old & unusual ones."
"Not happy at the moment, was billed twice this month, my next billing was suppose to be 3rd of july but i was debited early hours if this morning when my last billing was barely two weeks ago."
"Used to work well, now doesn't recognize my password. Works on some devices but not others. Needs fixing."
"Getting excessively expensive. Used to be a great value but now full of politically correct, left leaning programs"
"I've watched all I want and once you do that it's bot the best, but it does have several more shows and movie, they just don't interest me"
"Not able to update the app without network connection, no option to use mobile data which is all I have."
"With the latest updates, this app no longer works on my Motorola edge 30 neo. Android version is 13. Really hope it will be fixed soon."
Cool app which provide new new movies and series. But wish they have local payment system in every country.

We need a box where we can put our comments in series or episode like Crunchyroll
"Hii... I love the app.But so popular movies like after movie, the twilight series and the harry potter series are missing. .. Hope you can add them."
Lower the rates!! cause paying for internet or WiFi every month and the same amount just for Netflix series being available to us isn't fare enough
The new filter makes it so hard. We prefer to have a search rather than filtering. Like sometimes I search the name of an actors
"It caused a huge glitch in my divice, I do not like that at all. This service is paid for so I would live my full usage"
I have been watching a series and now I can't find it. I have to delete netflix and re install it. it gets me mad.

"Vivo s1 pro. Whenever I try to mirror netflix using my phone, only the sound being mirrored. No graphics. Please help."
Hey Netflix can you please make more fastforward options like x2 or x2.5 so i can binge watch a lot faster... it would be great.... thanks~

"It's okay, lots of show to watch. But I recommend to put ""Already Watch"" button so that it won't show in my suggestions anymore"
Good app besides some shows not have sessions but I understand and also removing good shows but otherwise good app!
One of the leading online streaming network is not having two step verification for an account. Team you can add the two step verification?
Though new titles are listed late than other regions still subtitles are not included for my region !! When calling customer care no one can do anything about it??
It's nice app
Dont think its worth the extra money they are charging... Hulu is just as good and a lot cheeper..
"overall Netflix is awesome I use It alot, it would just be nice if they updated it a little more often than they do,"
It has been amazing using this app but while I was watching a movie it told me to sign in and now I am signing in it is showing password incorrect
"Everyone overhypes this app, a lot of series and movies aren't here, mostly Netflix originals that'll you find, but overall, it's a great app"
I have only 1 issues only when i watch anime many episode already finished long time but in netflix still not updated..(example Fairy Tail üòÖ)
Same same... Amazon all the way. A lot of poor acting on Netflix... Cheesy TV.. Although some great. But not all of it..
"My netflix isn't connecting. It keeps saying ""Can't connet to Netflix"" when I'm literally connected."
I'm not able to add to my list no movie's or show's I added a bunch of stuff and then went to the list to watch and nothing I added was there
"Sometimes their NetFlix productions are highly racially sensitive others times the bias is intolerable. There is a cartoon avatar for the Chelsea Handler ""Privilege"" production that needs pulled. It depicts a Black woman on a very short pedestal and a White woman on a towering one looming above. Nothing that can be said or done in the so called ""flick"" or comedy production to erase that ugly image or make it a joke. Other Netflix movies are excellent. Film enters one's thoughts. Be caring."
"Nice app, but why do other movies or series say not available in your country. Hoping that the restriction change soon. üòî"
It won't let me watch The Ranch but will let me watch other things. Says it's the connection but my connection is just fine. Can we get this fixed please

"It doesn't show Supergirl series, but if you search in google it will tell you all 5 session of Supergirl is available in netflix but in real its not there"

At times I'm trying to watch a movie and when I select it for the movie to play my device (phone) restarts.

"They removed the best shows, but they added some new ones that are alright. Still not very happy about that though"

Love Netflix however app is constantly bugging so I have to uninstall and reinstall every day pretty much. Please sort on next update
Please remove the annoying automatic previews with the sound. It is really worth two stars!

"Film content leaves a lot to be desired, ok if you're into box sets though."
Annoying update my household. You got to come up with a better way. Im using same wifi for phone and tv. and still comes up.
"Good app just difficult to find really good titles. such as the Labyrinth, or Horton Hears the Who."
"Why you cancelled ""video on/off"" feature, i liked it, i usually watch my favorite sitcoms as podcasts while driving or before sleep"
Great show collection. Bad movie collection and also limited. No ratings or starts for movies and shows
My problem is for my T.V on a my show flowering heart it says theres a season 2 but it does not show it or says it. Besides that its a nice app.
Some good original movies but with all the other streaming services their movie selection is limited.
the quality of movie is good; but there is so much colour bending in movie so visually it is unpleasant....So pls fix this issue
Would love to give five but it is showing error again and again and I have to wait for a long time to fix that Please do something about it
Very good overall but when new stuff is add it takes a while for because of the dates apart from that very good overall would be a five stars otherwise.
I don't like how it takes shows off that I have been watching for weeks for example Raising Hope is a great tv show and for some reason they took it off I'm mad
"Unsure if it's due to an update, but can anyone shed light on why Netflix no longer asks if I'm still watching something?"
"Does NOT i repeat does NOT save any cut/ edited files, even though it will tell you successfully saved."
It won't even load. It shows nothing but a grey screen when trying to load Netflix.
I don't know why people like this BS!? It used to be great AF! Now they removed great shows for BS! I miss Metalocalypse & Robot Chicken. Straight Up!
Good app but why some shows are restricted to one country. Netflix please make every show available to everyone.
A bit annoying to use. Hard to navigate. Had to google how to download several episodes at once.
"I don't know what happened, but my app suddenly disappeared. I am trying to re install but it isn't downloading. PLS I need help."
Gotta Fix that bug where episodes or season just suddenly disappeared... people are paying for this... gotta do it better...

I've been a fan of korean dramas and i noticed that they change the music or song in some eps. like in the kdrama the Masters Sun.the song Nobody by Wonder Girls was supposed to be played but another song was played.i hope that they also check the searches made by the users and add kdramas/movies in areas that asks for more..or add a suggest a movie/series in the app so that they'll know what to add next..
Why do I have to keep netflix open just for the downloads to download? And why can't smart download detect when there's an episode missing?
"Amazing app, would without a doubt be 5 stars if regional locks were lifted on everything. We pay the same as other countries and America, so why should we get half the content?."
Makes me select my profile every time I open the app. Would like this to be an option on app/web to differentiate shared devices.
"Its good, the only thing that bothers me is am determined with content I have because of were I am, if soo give other payment package were we pay more to gate more from outside our regions.."
Everything is fine... add language bar also in which language the TV show or movie available.
"Lately there is nothing but fantasy series lined up in Netflix. I'm getting bored of Fantasy. I want some reality boys. Come on, you can do better than this."

When I play the hateful 8 extended version it acts like it's loading a long time during the movie so frustrating
"Excellent earlier but now a days worst series are coming like Rana Naidu which was worst series. It contains worst seens. If it avoids such a web series, then Netflix became no 1"

"Still no HD support for Note 10+, on the other hand great originals, flawless app."
"I give the three stars, That's because any movie we search by writing the name doesn't show in it. Please solve this problumes."
"Why can't I open my Netflix... Everytime I try to open it it's always: ""internet connection please try again later"" even if I have strong internet service"
Why don't Netflix have new episodes/season of certain shows? For example; Riverdale. Otherwise it's a good app.
"love all the cool new movies and series, just wish it were a little cheaper especially for us in Africa(Nigeria) who have to pay almost 3000Naira to watch monthly."

Good experience see classic show and netflix originals like stranger things or on my block I just wish they wouldnt delete all the disney movie classicsüò¢
"Riddled with foreign movies. I never watch movies with subtitles, so it would be nice to opt out"
"Wish they did not mix non-English films in with movies by categories They should be listed specified by language category's, otherwise itLove it and cost reasonable."
"How do I provide feedback to your head of sales in India? You need to bundle Netflix with telecom carriers like Airtel as do Amazon prime video, sony liv and Disney hotstar."
I cannot see the movie all i see is black screen but I cane here it and subtitle why is that it works perfectly fine on my phone but not my tablet
"works ok, would be so much better if I could filter out non-English speaking films in my searches."
It's great but recently when i play a movie it's super dark. I have to uninstall them reinstall to get it back to normal
The app is good and yes.... Try to reduce the cost in India region coz Rs.799 for one month is too much.
"Please Netflix's disable the ""are you still there"" feature it's super annoying!! Would give 5 stars if that wasn't there."
Needs more updates and new movies. Unsubsccribed due to this. I am not paying to see ONLY Netflix 2022/2021 movies only. No 2022 or 2021 theater movies at all.
I only rate it 3 ‚òÜ because Netflix is very late with all the shows and movies even with premium but other wise its ‚ô§
I dont know why but every time i wach it it go all the way back to the begining or all the way back to the first episode or SESSION .
honestly I just wish they had the whole anime series instead of fractions of it. Now I have to finish them somewhere else.
It's great but they just upload shows that never continue the season and is really annoying also need better movies but other than it's ok
"if you not able to purchase full anime or any series not show us half of it. I am very disappointed with that üòû for example- Tokyo ghoul,Naruto,Baki,etc."
Hello hey you guys should add some shows about BMX racing and freestyle it would really be a good idea but I won't stop using the app but it's just a suggestion
"Keeps disconnecting and slow to load. My wifi and mobile data works on YouTube but for this app, it doesn't"
Downloaded shows are no longer rotating. I can't watch anything in landscape.
"It keeps saying ""Too Many Downloaded Videos"" thus preventing me from downloading anything even when I'm the only one who has access to my account!"
It's just black screen when I try to cast in on another display but there's audio. Is this a bug or a feature?
It was going great but it stopped opening on my Samsung I tried clearing cache but it still won't open I deleted apps for more space and the same result
Service Interfece of this Awful... error code_1023 always dustrubed and all my Downloaded AVs' are automatically deleted when this interface is over you need to again Sign inüò°ü§íü§∫üé≠
The app keeps crashing after every few seconds without throwing any error on one plus 6T
The app have lots of amazing series and no buffering too. But you can make it free so its reach will be very high‚ò∫
I like the app but I don't like that there are no more descriptions when I click on a show or movie only tags.
"I was waiting for a tv show that says it's coming on Tuesday it seems that tv show hasn't been added yet I guess, can u please deal with the issue!"
Unable to grab the current offer for 1 year plan due to issues in the application.each time i am going to enter the otp for payment ...its reverting back...
"I can remember being able to read a short description of the media, but I don't think you can now. Could you please put it back again? I prefer to read about the story before watching something."

I don't really like this app because I can't find Monster High: 13 Wishes it is my second favourite movie and I can't find Frozen and it is my Favourite movie...Thats why I give it three stars...
Best app to watch a movie
"The app and my mac doesn't sync? I watched some episodes in my mac but somehow when i wanna continue in my phone, not the same episode. Kinda annoying"
Subscription compulsory. Good quality and quantity available of various web series and movies in different languages.
"Shows like Westworld, current season of TWD, and movies like 1917, midsommar, The light house are missing. Contents should be at par with US Netflix."
"Netflix good,and questionable,as much as the LGBT are questionable!(Has some,are most LGBT influence in shows,and movies! Otherwise it's a good app to a good company,Netlix!)"
It's a great app but when I finally found a good kdram I was interested In it suddenly logged me out and i try to log back in but is says its incorrect when I know the password
Fantastic application but my friends can't afford it's subscription. So o please issue some cheap subscription offers so they can also enjoy this app.
You need to add English to the disastrous life of saiki k. I hope you can do this and why are other shows removed some have been removed from my list I can't find them on netflix
I like some of the new things yall add but I hate that yall take off old TV shows that alot of people watch and see dont get to finish them before they are gone.
Not enough choice of old films and too many of the same kind .. always so called action and most of them are simply boring
"Need to Improve in important sections like play back speed, subtitle colour,Direct option to change quality."
I can watch things and it keeps me ocutpied when I'm bored but you need to add more and different movies cus I can't find certain movies that I wanna watch but the app is pretty good tho
id love to be able to watch more that what is showing. and im sorry but a movie cant be in all the catagories.
"Love the download section, but it would be nice to be able to download everything we wanted vs the limited library."
At the moment I can't even watch anything at all just get the dreaded loading symbol it's annoying as I'm paying money for something I can't use
"Nwtflix is a sweet deal, except that it still plays on a low resolution for android even on a gigabit connection."
I used to love Netflix but now I just like it and that's because they are taking away all of the good shows and movies so it's just getting boring now.
I love its content much but this app always gets crash and even didn't accept some of my cards as payment ...!!!! Why so serious????????
A very good app. Why can't we have a PIP mode view where it is minimized while using other apps
seriously netflix cacel my account and want to restart my membership but it keep saying problem with payment method and that is the only method to restart membership with the same card
"Lack of movies, they said it's on netflix but when I started search the movie that I want to watch it's none in there."

Some movies and TV shows that I want to watch aren't on Netflix. Like Modern Family and R. L Stine haunting hour etc....
"you have changed the navigation bar and now I can't access downloads or more, because they are under my back keys"
It was much better before they got rid of the rating system. Rumor has it that they got rid of the system because the Amy Schumer special was so poorly reviewed that they took off ratings all together. I hate that I have to leave the app to go read a review on another site.
"Netflix. Why would you take out season 1 of Bunguo Stray Dogs? There isn't even a season 4 yet. And you still took it out. But overall, it's good."

This app is good but not good because for one the movies on it are always old anything new bc its always just ends up being a kid movie or some anima that only got 1 sesen
Its great with operations. Eg no befferiing however i dont get some of the shows that is being broadcasted in amaerica and that.

Hi I love this app but there is a lot of movies missing like in miraculous season four is not there and it's been a month and it's still not there
I'm paying for this yet there is so little show and it seems like if the show isn't so popular they remove it which is annoying becuz I'm paying for it u should get what I payed for

"Why should we continue to pay for increases to the app, when it continuously kicks us out and has daily problems? And you are yet again raising is a year later? Incredible."
I'm not a fan of the latest update removing the ability to specify where to cast to without the content already playing.
A great app indeed only that once logged out your downloaded videos are deleted from the app but not from the storage.

"i have some problems in the app when i'm running out of data, it crashes and says about restarting the smartphone"
Content is good but Netflix only accept visa mastercard.many indian user can't Netflix subscription because of this reason.so Netflix focus on this problem & solve this immediately.add payment like upi rupay & wallets
Does not have enough nice movies and all of them are outdated. This app is in need of new movies.
Rly rly good but always getting rid of the good stuff
I enjoy Netflix with all of there originals. Disappointed they don't have movies that they didn't make.
I LOVE netflix and it movies and shows but i don't like how it doesn't have all the seasons on the shows.
It was a good app but afterwards when i try to download something they notify that downloads are only available on wi-fi.Stupid app now.
Haven't use it yet. I will wait until you have another payment method other than debit or visa because I don't have both of them. üò©
Would be great were it not for constant playback errors and low volume.
"Why do you guys keeps removing good shows and yet keeping trash shows like riverdale and hypehouse üíÄ, y'all better give us ST level shows after stranger things S5 drops bc theres nothing good to watch specially on horror and thriller genre"
After the update I can't seem to watch any movie ..including downloaded movies it would not just open at all .üòíüòíüòí
"Can we finally get options for changing subtitle colour (transparency), and size? Also goes for TV version of application (LG oled)."
Used to be great but lately too many foreign made movies with bad actors and copying good American movies especially from India.
its good and all.. but... people need to realize that there r people in this world who CANNOT PAY to watch movies on a screen...
Please work on the payment method via visa. It always says something's wrong and cannot bill be automatically every billing date

Ever since i factory reset my üì± i havent been able to watch netflix. It never gets past the Netflix symbol
I'm kinda annoyed I liked how it has shows I like but why doesn't it have the movie epic? Hulu & Disney+ don't have it either...Epic is a great movie and I wanna watch it on Netflix

cast button not showing. I've restarted & forced stopped the app and it still doesn't show it.
"Please add audio languages and subtitles languages details also in Movies and web series discription along with Cast,Creator, Maturity Rating and Genres It will help people to know without playing any content plz Its already available on Amazon Prime."
Doesn't support region language for most. Would have been better if Tamil is also part of available audios.
The app is great before they added the Russian shows but that is because I can't really see any Russian language to watch (I speak Russian)
App is good and it as good features compare to other OTT app but there are no yearly offers . Please do updated about this.
"So I'm watching Lucifer and when I'm almost at season 3, and now I cant watch the last few episodes in season 2 on my phone, but only on my ps4"
It used to be a really great app but lately they've been taking off all the good movies and shows and producing their own
Be good if you can watch a while sequence of movies like all the transformers all the madeas as we do pay for it monthly be nice to get your money's worth
"Every episode of a show or movie I'm watching the subtitles keep coming on when I have TURNED them off, it's getting ridiculous"
Love it and price is good. The only reason I haven't rated it more if because there are a few things I can't find. One of them being Dharma and Greg
It will glitch a lot and the app removes a ton of shows It gets quite boring after a while and i cant download my favorite shows
It keep stop working at the time of launching. This is the sixth time i am reinstalling the app.
"We need a screen touch lock option while playing the videos, like other popular players. Thank you."
There is no internet banking . My card is blocked for some reason and I am unable to do internet banking. It is better we had that option also.
It is great but there are curtain series and movies that play on Netflix in other countries that I wish played her in south Africa too .
"Movies and shows are mid, but it has the best UI out of its competition"
"Asking too many personal data ?. AND...I never heard of the choices I made for answer 3 & 4. I know Gray's anatomy, but don't like it. So YOU JUST FORCED ME to pick two choices I've never heard of. Would YOU like THAT. I hear your answer is ""You're exactly right Mrs Herrick, why did WE think of that. OK all you milenials (or myrmidons) back to work lil snowflakes work real hard lil myrmidons. (You will be expected to Google this part! Cherio Sgt.Major!"
It is good for movies but for shows Disney + wins
Too many 2.119 errors! Have to delete downloads and re-download all the time. Whats the point?
"I don't want game adverts on home screen, need option to remove, no settings to stop automatic play video when browsing so annoying üò§"

My fav animes are not available with English audio.. But in other countries it is available..yyy? Make it available in India also
I love Netflix so I can chill but the thing is you have to pay for it but I do not want to pay every month so I give a 3 if it was free I can give it a five
Add outlines for the subtitles. I cannot read a white colored subtitle when the background is also white.
Please allow HDR and FHD playback on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G. It still says HDR None in Playback Specifications. The phone is HDR capable
Why app didn't even working now a days. Please resolve this issue. It is suddenly closing when I tried to press on my login ID
Lately when i play movies the screen freezes and the sound keeps playing i don't think it's because of my internet connection Where can i get help?
Sometimes movies etc didn't play at all and when they did it was sometimes just a blank screen with the sound
"Lot of network issue, I have uninstalled & installed the app several times but still connection issue still not resolved."
It's said it loading at the stranger things and it won't play at the season 1 and the Mad Max even though I'm not full storage. NETFLIX fix this
I can't find movies that are in other people's Netflix device like one piece others have it but my own Netflix doesn't show it please fix it
Doesn't download shows on my phone (even though i have enough space). It was always on 0% since i left it overnight
Please add the feature to show whether the video is playing in 720p or 1080p while streaming like Amazon Prime.
"I'm giving only 3 coz for such a huge company Netflix , i cant understand why u guys can't give us imdb rating or some other rating for every show and /or movie. And what sort of stupid update description is this. If i dont know what is being updated why d hack would i update it."
The app is somewhat great only thing is that on the phone at least I feel like it gets updates every other week which is kind of annoying
I have a problem I am not able to open Netflix I restarted my phone reinstalled but till I am not able to open it and also not able to contact with ur no. also plzzz check
All movies should have option to hear in English. I usually don't watch if you can't and I give a thumbs down.
Started off paying $7.99 a month... Now I have a notification telling me it's gonna be $13.99 a month. üôÑ
CONS: Takes up storage. Lags. Needs WIFI. PROS: Good for when bored. Good login. Good Show/Movie(s)
Dont you support backward compatible for the app.. Why you force us to update the app by crashing itüòñüòñüò† please try to give backward compatibility
NOBODY wants 1.25x playback speed. It's too fast and sounds weird. Give us 1.10x and 1.15x
Too slow to update the new episode series of anime One Piece ...the other websites I near finish it... Do a double time Netflix.
Its good or bad. For example:trolls world tour isnt going to be on Netflix until next year. But its still goint to be on netflix
Was very enjoyable for the last few months but then abruptly the cooumn fo downloads was nolonger available. Very disappointed üíî
App just doesn't stream anything so often. Have to force stop it just to get it to work.
"Sorry guys, but smartphone-wise, this time you messed it up. Everything stays in ""loading"" phase on smartphone."
There's a glitch where you screen freezes but the audio keeps on going.
I don't know what's wrong with ths app recently I can't watch films in hd quality even when I changed that in settings
have to change from audio description to normal audio in every f*ing video. Why can't it save my preference??
"it is very nice, it doesn't have ANY adds, i can take it wherever i have internet ... but it does buffer a lot"

"Netflix OTT platform is very bad ,uploads very bad bad content,which I am ashamed to say ,I want to get away from Netflix , uploads sexual content,and spends money to make Sex Contain Netflix company, no shame Netflix Company"
Lots of shows to watch but needs to add ones that are only on different countries such as legacies should be on the UK netflix
Login problem.. Sometimes the app needs to login again but fail to do so when the password is correct..
"Cannot get past the logo screen, tried uninstall, reboot, cache and data wipe but nothing. I'm using an LGg8x"
While forwarding the video .screen is freezes and only 10sec video is forward
I love watching anime on netflix and I was in the middle of death note (the anime series) and they either deleted it or it's not there anymore but please add more animes !!
Netflix is good but they are geting rid of really good movies like Space jam and I know that the movie is old but it's amazing.
I like to watch Riverdale and season 4 came on to Netflix October 9th 2019 and Netflix on my TV or phone seams not to have it also going with other series.
Brightness slides not working on my s23 ultra
They take a lot of good movies and shows off but still works great for everything else.
"Cant download. I was trying to download but i am not able to. Its saying ""too much downloads on too many devices"" but i didnt have any downloads."
Brilliant but would like you to add a leaving soon list so you can watch it before it goes especially when its on your watch list
Ive been trying to get the app into my phone for quite a while now and its the only app that has been unsuccessful considering the availability of phone storage
"Why can't I remove shows from my ""continue watching"" anymore? I've started several shows only to realize that they were terrible."
"Netflix is good, but where the hell is search baar all of a sudden ? I guess it was removed in this version of app."
We pay the same price for Netflix as everyone else yet we don't get all the shows because we live in the Caribbean
I wish they could abolish the rule where you can only download some of a season on the phone without having to stream it online
"All great content, but a bit expensive. I'm looking forward for better pricing."
"Its very easy to use,but i am watching anime and it has no other season Like:food wars I wish it has season 4 Thank you very much for the best service I wish you are working to itüòÖ"
"This app is very good and most of the time I am on Netflix but the only reason I gave this app a 3 star rating is bc there are not a lot of new kdrama in it. The app has like 80% old kdrama and 20% new kdrama. I don't know if it's bc I am in France or some but please download some new kdrama in the French Netflix , I would really appreciate if you do. Example of kdramas that are not in netflix that are very popular: what is wrong with Ms. Kim, melting me softly. Please do something about this."
"Great app, it's got a bunch of good shows but ever since they took of ""Pokemon Sun And Moon"" I have just thought of the app as garbage so please add Pokemon sun and moon back on 3 stars right now but if they put Pokemon sun and moon back on then I'll change my review to 5 star. Please add Pokemon sun and moon again Please."
New interface is very bad üëé. Category titles are not available anymore.
"It's good for watching stuff when you're bored, but lots of times I cant find shows that I WANT to watch. So yea"
"Great but I hate that they differentiate between countries (like American, Japanese, German Netflix) and then use VPN detection"
"It randomly stopped opening, it just freezes on the main screen."
"If T-Mobile didn't start paying for my Netflix.. I wouldn't subscribe again. What happened to you, Netflix üòî"
It is very good app but it has taken alot of the shows off that i like and i would love for you to put back ben 10 alien force and ultimate alien please
Well theres thid bug keep happening to me For ex. When i use netflix today and when i use it the next day it told me to log in again pls fix it
"App is like the others, sometimes too many ads and other times all right."
The ads....are we paying you to show us some ads during a movie?the whole ad thing just makes Netflix look hella trash.DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU DONT WANT TO WATCH ADS DURING A MOVIE
its a decent app takes a long time to turn on sometimes and doesnt have a lot of options for tween to young teen ages
"Netflix has a removed allot of great shows and Im kind of pissed about it. atleast there are some good shows, but only some"
I'm still confused why is the app not have some anime movies like a silent voice I'm from the Philippines but when I search it on chrome it said there is a silent voice movie in netflix
The application needs development. It fails to connect to the network even with a 10gbps Internet connection.
"Great app but please put back the "" remove from row"" option. It's missing now. Thank you."
This is just a idea it could help with sales in the US but you guys should add Rick and Morty to the u.s. Netflix so we don't have to use a VPN to watch it
"why am I getting a ""you can't see this episode on mobile devices"" code? If I can't see my fave shows on the go then why even have Netflix?"
It does not have much shows or anime. I'm very satisfied with the amount of Korean Dramas on Netflix but other than that it's a big mess
great app really but the new layout doesnt work with my android tablet. what i mean is i cant open the search menu with or even other genres
My screen gets stuck while watching my. Animes I watch fairy tail for now the audio only continues pls take care of this issue üòâ‚ù§Ô∏è thanks for reducing the rates of Netflix i. India love u for that

I think thus app is bad because ever were j go I can't use it because it won't connect to my Netflix even if I'm outside my house
"kept having error message, failed to load, when I try to watch New and Hot section, please fix it."
Previously I used to have a Lock Screen option while watching a Show. But Now I'm not having that Option. I don't if it's the app or my Device ?
The phone everyday says device failure and mine is a new phone bought 4 months back and that to a one plus 8t I don't know why but I. Watching a video and it suddenly video shuts of after 5 mins
Loved the app until the most recent update. Now it kicks me out whenever I try to fast forward or rewind.
Netflix service in India is not worth subscribing. Every movies you got to see are cut censored versions. There's a lot of interference of Government censorship to preserve our 'culture'.
It is showing app error...some times it doesn't showing anything just closing itself...I don't know why...iam tired of it
Very good app to movie download but so many network issue in this app my network is so good but I saw everyday network issue in this app first fix this problem and i will give 5 star.
Prices have gone up without any quality entertainment. I'll subscribe again when it's worth while.
they need to change the movies around Moore to get more options or keep adding more movies to it faster make the new seasons come in faster
"They dont have much new animation or Hollywood comedy movies, they have old movies, what is the meaning of watching old ones. please have some new movies also."
UNetflix is always a bit late in telecasting anime....other than that.. introduce hindi dubs/subs for foreign language based shows especially anime..
Its a good app to watch movies and other things but when i was waching lucifer on the end of the 3 season the app didn't let me wach the rest until i uninstoled the app and up dated it.
Its got some good shows and movies but im a big Western movie fan and not much to choose from that aint fake Western ..how about more john wayne movie selection if possible thanks

"Don't know if newest update or something else, but seems to maximize screen brightness while playing."
"It was working fine now it won't work, I've uninstalled and then installed again, all I get is the Netflix logo"
"Great app!!but the main reason why I gave it 3 stars,it's because Netflix does not have access to all movies..."
"When we browse any series, the year of release should be mentioned for every season of the series."
App is good but customisations are very less. Like adjust bandwidth.
Why cant I open my Netflix app? Juz updated few days ago.. Now only the black screen with the Netflix logo on it appears. Nothing else.

Please older version is very much good No need of new version of list view....please give a new update....and don't want list view. Please.....3 star only because of list view...

Why is it when I download a movie on Netflix and watch it later it has a error 5.7 I've done everything to fix it.
I can't look at my whole list. When I scroll it starts loading and I can never keep scrolling down my list.
would be good if the movies you searched for were actually there. YOU misspel a movie title then it shows correct spelling for a title and there's no movie
"Its good app though..... but the only thing that i'm not satisfied is that you dont release the whole season of some tv series like impractical jokers, family guy.... e.t.c ... if u fix this problem it would be the best"
Its one of the best streaming platform but netflix need work on in indian languages such as hindi and many more otherwise it best to entrainment OTT.
I don't like the content anymore Obviously Netflix lost a lot in these recent years hope they fix this and become the old Netflix we all know
Iv used Netflix for a while it was awesome until i decided to end membership Now iv been trying to restart membership and they keep telling me the card which i was using has an issue please help meeee

Streaming is good.. but sometimes when I open the app it keeps loading n unable to start the show or film
"This app is the topmax of all apps that you can imagine. The app is very fast, very good and above all the app is reliable."
It's very good but there are not many TV shows/movies that are with Bulgarian subtitles.
Most of time I can'tsee video. Automatically playing audio only. please fix ot
too much costly comparison to other provider specially in india... it cost approx 1500 / year / user that's sufficient.... otherwise people use alternate methods üòÉ
Its a great app but it doesn't show full anime on there it only shows 1 or 2 seasons so if netfliz would add more seasons to anime then i would like it more
"Good app, but they cancelled inside job for another season of big mouth. Also, picture in picture doesn't work."
"it was good untill I deleted and buy it again. It kept on telling me ""sorry we can not reach the Nexflix service"" so I'm not sure what to do because I was so happy that a ep came out today üò¢"
Need more horrors on.. You have a lot of foreign ones and for me as a huge horror fan your film base is limited. You add more I will give you 5 stars x
It was good but now every time I go to watch it on my phone I have to put it off so it does not show the words when I'm kind of watch a show
App is set to update automatically and again it didn't. This is getting really old with all my apps doing this
Good app but some series only have one season even when I search for some movies not available pls this is not good pls can u guys add more shows and more series so it will more enjoyable
Why this (-1023) error is encountered. After some time have to sign in again all the downloads are gone.

"ssword problem: everytime i change password to login, i am always sure that the password that i just put then after 2 day i try to login using the correct pssword and email it say password incorrect"
The app is pretty good overall but there are some crappy movies and it doesn't cover all ages like 10 to 13 year olds and the 60 year olds and up
Little box thing when I go to home screen gets stuck on my phone. I'm on orio 8.1. I dunno if it's just my phone.
Same movies. No variety. Paying for the best package and its like any other from what i have seen.
"i love this app but when i want to download , it said can't download because u have download it in other device . it's wrong to download in other device . please fix this üôè it's not wrong btw . üòíüôÑ"
They should fix the continued watching! When a show is done it does not go to the next show anymore.
The app before the update was very smooth. Videos just shows downloading but doesn't download
Right so right now while writting this a few min ago i accidentally loged out and I can't get back in so dont log out make sure ur parent remembers ur password otherwise best app ever i recommend watching INSATIABLE really good show.
Need more frequent rotation of movies and shows. Tired of seeing stuff that was on there a year ago.
Its good to watch anything you want but its cost is exceed for some users thats why some people can't have netflix subscriptionü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I have been on Netflix a while and now there are ads popping up when I am watching my show/movie.
I don't know if in other countries is the same but in Romania we have a lot(most ) of old and very old movies.I can see same movies on Tv channels.
Its pretty good with its system but for some shows and movie it wont allow me to watch them I checked my internet and I didnt everything but nothing worked
I like Netflix but the prices keep increasing. I haven't had a raise at my job in 10 years and the price of gas keeps increasing. At this rate I'll have no choice but to cancel my membership. The charities I donate to are more important.
Why is it when I try to download episodes it keeps saying this title is not available to watch instantly.please help to solve this problem
I feel like you should get more movies do that it'll be easy for viewers like me because I've been checking if netflix has after buh doesn't and I was disappointed
Screen rotation turn off option is not there. It's becomes very worst to us Netflix
I like the app but at the same time I think Aj and the queen should have been renewed for a 2nd season it said there was controversy so they didnt but yet they had that show cuties on there yhat caused quite an issue but they still ran it
All was great till I updated. Since the update I have been getting issues and the shows are not showing my phone
The app is fine. You have to pay monthly for service. They keep increasing the monthly amount.
Please stop changing the cover or thumbnail of the movie. Also please make it easier to remove items from the To Watch List.
It is good but it say again ' we having a problem connecting to Netflix and please try network or problem network' . Please fix this soon
please add easy paisa or jazz cash in payment method. only credit and debit card is not a good option for the Pakistan.

It alright but one thing i suggest you guys try to bring shows like dragonball z or kai and one piece into netflix because those two shows are my favorite anime shows
Good app for streaming but in resent time they are not able to produce good contant like viking viking velhala Netflix team please work on it make some more series
Sound of the music on any movie start automatically very loud after actors talking time! Very enjoying!!!
Good but the only movie I would watch is battleship I used to watch it like 6 times a day so please keep the movie battleship on Netflix
"What is going on with the new update? The audio works but there are no images, not great."
They need to update their movie list more often. I feel like they take too long to add new things to watch.
At first I loved it but lately it's really glitchy and it takes forever to load and it's not my wifi so it's ok but not great
The last 2 days the app has been bad for me all the rest of the years and days has been okay I've been talking to people to try to get this after work but it's not working for me I went on the app chat and talk to five people they still couldn't get to work and I told him I am not going to pay for something I cannot see so I'm giving them Tuesday to get it right
It's always good ..but I have a severe problem...My other friends can get Screen shot and Screen recordings here but I can't...why Discrimination?.. can't it be helped
Contents ok.. But worst streaming experience.. Keeps buffering in between the movie.. So irritating
"Love the app but it's refusing to open since I redownloaded it, really frustrating, that's why I deducted 2 stars"
There are times that it won't show a video but it plays and there are sounds. A bug maybe?
Hi... This is the 4th time I am installing the app after uninstalling it as it suddenly stops working
Ideally we should have all subtitles available and the possibility to have double subtitles to learn a language
Not a bad app but Netflix is always removing shows that alot of people are watching so it ruins it for everyone's enjoyment.
Netflix shows never usually completed the full seasons. because to finish shows I always have to go to the internet
I know this may be my phones fault but I hate having netflix on my phone and the fact i cant delete it off my phone is even more BS that i dont want.
Lag lag lag lag even more lag. Cant watch 5 minutes of one movie without sudden had quality and a frozen screen
Please solve the payment issue.. I have recharged for last month with my card.. but I am not able to pay now.. whenever I am putting the otp.. it takes me back to the payment info update page.
I'm unhappy with the app update. It's too dark. And I had the in app controls for the lighting.
Is it just me or everyone is having this issue that payment is not being accepted and it says plz try again.. üôÑüôÑ so annoying please fix this issue for your regular customers
keeps telling me that content is not available to watch immediately. used to be able to watch while on the go. not happy
App is great just the show an movie options are not amazing as it's all the same and I want better options
"New update doesn't work with Chromecast, there is no button to cast."
Worked perfect until update to Android 11. Unable to login or open now. Hope fix won't take long
Not so much good to explore.. except sacared games & ghoul nothing so much interested.. so i don't think it's batter to take subscription n pay money for that app..
"TV shows and movies should be ""rate-able"" by the people who view them completely so the new viewers who want to binge TV shows have an idea of how good the show is..."
"Screen keeps on freezing from time to time on my oppo f11 pro and oppo a12. The message says ""Device failure occured. Please try again (500-116)"". Please fix this"
Why does it not allows you to watch a season again...? Ex. A show has 3 seasons and if I want to watch season 1 again it doesnt plays..it by default selects season 3
Seen the comedy film the delivery guy on the list checked it out in the trailer everything was lit then left netflix for a few mins went back to watch it and it's gone from it whats the crack there
This new update screwed it all up everytime I hit my list it backs me out of the app idk why you guys keep messing with a good thing if it ain't broke dont fix it
"Average. Poor quality compared to other jurisdictions, poor selection depending on location in the world."
When it works it's good but most of the time my screen will freeze but it will still play audio
Add more movies and TV Series even the old ones. But it's been an amazing experience with this App.
There some shows that aparently are added on Netflix but when i search for them they're not appear on the list.
Overall good experience... I have purchased VR recently...wish i could try to see netflix in VR mode...but unfortunately Samsung A50s doesn't support... wish u guys can fix this problem.
it is a great app to watch movies on.. but all my movies suddenly start talking in spanish and i dont know what's causing it..
For some time the app is delayed in starting.I donot know the reason for it but I think it starts time lag after update.
I really love this app it has so many movies.. but sadly you need to pay so you can watch some movies. But it's worth it.
"Getting worse. Great streaming service, poor qpp plays sound but no video, what's up with that?"
"I can never get into it, is very irritating when you're trying to open Netflix and you can't even get into it"
Great movie and show streaming site but seriously stop taking stuff off you guys took off bloom into you and that was great I was still watching it when it was taken off made me pretty mad
When I try to update the app it says waiting for wifi or less download now but data charges may apply but when I press download now nothing g happens.
It was working great till now but resume function is not working when I quit the app and come back again while watching downloads
Why nowaday there always happen to be error when i try to watch some movies. It show( errors 5.8) what that mean?
netflix is good if u like watching the same thing over and over trying to find a movie to watch but theres nothing good so pick something youve seen 100 times and barley pay attention to it
It was working good before but uts now bot even opening in my phone i have to keep unistalling and installing again and again pls solve this issue as soon as possible
It is a great app ......only thing is if it can show more best Korean movies .. I as a viewer would have no complaints then
The HDR doesn't work. The videos are a bit blurry and you see rainbow spots on things like people's faces.
I'd be glad if you people stop turning down shows and movies we love. Ugh. Most of my favorite stuff are getting deleted.
It's an ok app...it has taken down shows and really good movies I wish it had more disney shows and movies and more action movies to.
It's good but it's kind of sad because some of the shows that are available on netflix from other country aren't available in my country.
Series keeps crashing. Have to uninstall app to correct. Very inconvenient
"M having issues with playing my downloaded movies,it keeps writing there was an error playing the video for days now.how can that be resolved.?"
"Relly good app, nothing about the app is bad, but can you all keep streaming the show called El Barco, i really want to finish it?"
It's great but I already changed my subtitle appearance but it is still the same. It is so frustrating.
Netflix is the best üëå but not all the movies are Available and the data cost too much
Definitely needs better top scale movies of higher quality. C'mon Netflix. Spend serious money to make really good movies.
I love the app.. but it has crashed. It's been about a week and I cant get on. Please fix this!

"After the latest update, it took so long just to open the app. Wonder what's going on in the background. More than a minute just to open the app."
It's cool but right now it's messing up because the voice is delaying from the pictures that are showing its annoying
The application is not not being launched in my phone... 2 days ago i was using very smoothly but now this problem is irritating so much...
The brightness is fixed when full screen and it is too much during night hours.
Recent Movies are Old Movies. Not worth the Money to Pay for.. Prices just went up when it should of actually went Down. Why pay all that Money for Old Movies.. Not Worth it
Please make the subtitle color black or readable. Im watching anime and cant even see the subtitles because its very bright.

"Always gliching and having WiFi problems. When it is not though, it it really cool."
If you keep our favorite British shows and your ratings will be higher. You took away Father Brown. Many of us like watching re-runs so assuming your customers watched all episodes and won't watch them again cuts out a big chunk of your market.
A lot of shows are gone from Netflix Uk. I am very disappointed. It used to be good with a lot of good shows.
"It says it has ALL your movies, but it doesn't. I searched for a movie and it brought up everything but the movie."
"I like netflix, but im kind of mad because they're taking everything good off. Popular shows are being taken off and it sucks."
"Videos are too dark, even with my screen brightness maxed. Makes viewing on the phone incredibly unenjoyable. Please fix. Samsung Note 9"

"I love netflix but they have old movies and tv shows wich is boring, at least have the vampire diaries, the originals and the legacies"
it's great media to watch but sometimes it gets stuck in one place like for hours !!!!!!üòÅ

"there r so many movies that's not here, it's only good because of subtitles and quality."
Same old same old The same content as there was a year ago
I would have give 5 star but I rated this because payment method accepted is only for visa or master card I think that is why most people are not subscribing Netflix Most of the card here are rupay We don't have visa or master card you don't have rupay card Please consider
The new update is very bad
"Why remove haikyu, I watched it seven times and planned on watching it seven more. Bring it back, along with the rest of it!"

Very good useful app but expensive in it's way and they remove all the good TV shows and movies
I love Netflix but I choose free trial pack and they deducted 799 RS from my account. it was so disappointing. üôÅ
I love Neflix... but honestlyn I find it annoying that there is many non-English mixed with english tv shows/movies. Can you please group non-English movies under there own category.
If the video is paused for any reason I have to hit the fast forward or rewind for it to play again.
Its fine but I don't like how it doesn't have a lot of movies that are very famous and some movies get taken down after a period of time
"right now my main concern is as ive played my dowloaded series, it says can't play video like it does not autoplay like it did before."
Needs newer content that is not a snore and should ask there clients what type of shows and or movies they like so it seems like there more interactive with there clients
I hate how it only has some of the seasons for animes it's annoying since I cant finish them and netflix should add more anime.
It's a nice app
The experience is GOOD...only issue is the error message(s) that frequently disturb my GOOD experience.
I mainly use this for Ninjago I am a long time fan and left the show when I got to season 9 in 2018. Hasn't been touched since. Season 10 11 12 and soon to be 13 is not there for me but it is for other people.
App is good for watching content. Keeps crashing on Android.
"Do not show a lot of up to date movies. I see the same movies that I saw years ago. I also like the good old movies I like comedies, and adventure movies."
I would have gave this app 5 stars but for some reason the videos on my screen are so dark I cant even watch them and my brightness is up all the way.. üò°
could you guys please add the option to change the quality of content i am watching on my mobile and also on the web. fix this and I'll buy the subscription again...
"love when it automatically paused when I plug-off my earphone & having my fav shows, but two stars snatched because poor security as I found someone using my account illegally"
Though the app is good but sometimes it make me irritated when my download episodes doesn't play and sometimes they doesn't open
Love the app and netflix. But never putting full series on some really good shows and takea forever for new stuff.
"I enjoyed this app until the latest update, which stopped the ability to screen cast/mirror from a phone to tv."
"loved it at first, but seem to run out of good content after a while... you watch the stuff you like and then its b movies..."
"I couldn't not start my membership with RUPAY card., Now most of the Banks issue only RUPAY Card in my Location., It will increase the number of Users if it is accepted..."
Plz add the feature to increase the playback speed..Also add the option to change the skip time to 5 seconds..
"was better, still decent . Need to upgrade and change shows and movies more often."
Its very awesome but at the same time its not 'cause I love wathing a show i would say but when a new season comes it never comes on netflix same goes for a new movie or a new episode of something
Its a great app but it does not have all episodes of a show I was watching. I hope they fix this!
"I used to live Netflix, i have been disappointed lately though that they havee dropped a lot of dubbed anime content though."
It good but. It hits each time I watch a moive it play sound it not my tv cuz I got a new tv so fiz this problem I would of give it 5 star it so annoying
"I just wish I could watch all of my favorite anime that are available on this app, it's so unfair, well, this app was too good to be true."
New update wont load properly plus very slow. Have to close and re open app.
"The movies are great, but i can't watch it because i haven't subscribe yet. It needs purchase to use the app"
After update i cant download any more videos.. it always shows your download is full... but i deleted the video... plzzz fix this as asap...
Why can I cast my stuff on my tv?? Where did the little icon go?? Where I can click and see it on my smart TV? Anyone else having this isssue
Dislike automated app Brightness. I just want it to be the the bright tone i have it set to be before i go into the app
Constantly freezes automatically even when the internet is good and though I've a 8gb ram .
Well I am hear to report something going on with my t.v it keep everytime I log into it it plays a little then kicks me out and restarts a couple of seconds back
Why do downloads pause when you switch to another app? This should be checked because its frustrating when you want to download a movie
"Getting expensive now with ¬£11 a month to get HD and ¬£16 for 4K, yet the content has gotten pretty poor."
I am facing problem in completing the payment .. everything was okay .. but from last month it suddenly stopped completing my payment even after entering the OTP
Would be 5 but I passionately hate the fact it controls the brightness and I can't use the brightness slider in the pull down bar
"Just please add an option where I can choose the quality of watching or quality of downloading, I hate watching stuff for less than HD"
Its an alright streaming platform but ever since the new update it isnt the same and theyve also stopped streaming some of my favorite tv shows and movies
Wish it would show more options of something to watch. Keep showing me the same shows over and over.
love the app actually but they keep on going up up up in the price but always have the same things on their then most all the good originals were cancelled
"Is ok, not the best streaming place I can find cheaper easier, but not all the movies. 3/5"
Love Netflix but this new Dark Crystal commercial that keeps interrupting our shows is literally driving me nuts. When will this stop?
need to have netflix like everywhere else in some countries they have a better selection of movie and in the us have a different selection
Good app but need to add more movies in India .....there are very selective content to watch
Season selection dissappeared in landscape mode.. its outside the frame.. a bit sloppy
Contents are too low in india but your charging the same amount. We need other countries content more too
netflix pretty good but my problem is that the fact is i`m only seeing the previews and i can`t get to watch any shows because of it
I gave it 3 stars because my experience is generally not bad but still not the best because sometimes the audio doesn't move at the same rate as the video
I was watching the vampire diaries and then it was removed from my Netflix. I understand why it isn't on my list but I was really hoping to have it back
After the latest update my Netflix account is not able to play FULL HD on my smart phone which supports widevine L1 .
I like the app cos it make all the movies I wan available buh person go use money subscribe and without data I still can watch what I subscribed for like...............
"Why is it i cannot sign up? For how many days, i cant access/use netflix. I try to call help support but to my dismay contact failed, cant process"
It was a very good experience
Using netflix been great but sometimes unable to use because other users are on it despite i am the proprietor account.
"it need to give me the option to chose the quality of the movie .to save the internet package,sometimes.."
I would love to know why an app you can download on google play doesn't have an option to pay with a google play card. It is a legit for of payment.
"Netflix was great, however some anime episodes are incomplete.... Pls add naruto shippuden in netflix because that anime is part of our childhood thank you!"
But you r version is not compatible with our android box. So we don't enjoy Netflix on big screen
Dunno if it's a bug or what but lately it often downloads anime episodes without subs so I have to re-download them again
Tv Series Seasons continuation is unreliable. Was watching Z nation. At season 5 they ended the entire series without notice.
Price upgrade 2 or more why not upgrade better Moves & TV Series.? There all ready watch most of Funy part is 4out2 rewatch.my like. !
"We need screenshot update, just screenshot only. There were series we want to promote to our friends."
why does it stops at night time whenever I open it shows could connect with Netflix . I have the sim of jio.
"Overall it's good, but the download function suddenly disappeared and all my downloads are gone as well, what happened?"
I love the app but some of the shows I've watched get removed in the middle of the season which really sucks
Can't scroll watchlist. Glitch bug. A very annoying issue because I want to scroll through my watchlist.
I am no longer able to watch movies since I upgraded to the standard package. I am very disappointed in this fact.
I enjoyed Netflix till the day tried to login at they tell me that srry we could not reach the server please try again later(-9) with all my bundles we need asolution the the error pls
The app doesnt open on my vivo v7 plus. I have uninstall and install again to make it work. Please fix this
"Replying to your tagline: We audience never worry about what to watch next. Life is much more than just Netflix as we have so little time. So, I think you need to worry about how to drop prices and add quality content in so little time."
Works great. Could have different movies instead of the same ones in different categories
I love watching netflix but for some reason on my phone I can't watch movies/TV shows it's a black screen... Idk why but it's only on my phone in my family?
Great app. The only problem is that most trending movies are not available.
It's definitely an App that entertains us. But why do you remove some real good series like Lost???
I have had a paid member ship for a year now and it now won't show any movies just blank boxes you need to extend the download period as well
"There is this certain show I want to watch but it won't let me. Any other show works, just not this one. This is a problem that needs to be fixed. The show is criminal minds. Thank you."
I don't like it as much as I used to they took down andy Griffith show and I love that show they should add it back and also add looney tunes
I love it but when ever a new episode comes out I have to delete Netflix then reinstall it I don't know if it's my phone or its Netflix
"when we Search any movie then it shows a lot of movies..i think it is a big problem to find favourite movie..solve this prblm early to early,üòÄ"
Why my country doesn't have Aquaman the movie by DC?? But when i go to Japan i have saw the movie at this app.Maybe its location problem?
"If you see this message then Please add ""Remove option in Continue watching list"" ....rest its good and a perfect time killer"
"Want more of the shows all of the way to last season, not just Criminal minds,only part of them And more old movies"
It has good shows but it doesn't have all the seasons and I wish they had the whole TV show instead of just part of it.
"The reproduction bugs and stills black screen with the audio, not solved, :("
some shows are missing seasons eg miraculous ladybug its missing season 3 part 1 and 2 on my phone but on my friends phone its there you need to do something about that otherwise its a very good app but do domething about it
I like netflix but the only problem is that I can't watch naruto shippuden :( I really want to watch it is the company ever bring Naruto Shippuden to netflix
"The problem is... Well, the prices have gone up,but there's less I want to watch so I'm cancelling until it get better."
Indian and specifically Hindi / Marathi content is not much available on Netflix. Hollywood titles are also mostly B grade movies.
Happy days!!! Square Eyes and a few extra pounds but loving every minute of it.
Everything is great except for payment methods. You people should include RuPay debit card in payment methods.
To many films that are not in my language. That's why there's a language selection setting. At least that's what I thought it was for.
New update fixed my soundbar issues so yay 3 stars instead of 1 now. Minus 1 star because your parental ratings need adjusting and minus another star because you're expensive Netflix. 3/5
"it doesn't let me download anymore and I'm only logged in on one device so I'm the only one downloading but they keep saying ""too many downloads on another device"" or something"
after the update my netflix is not working..i cant open the app...i reinstalled it but still not working..plz help me...
I like Netflix but i ran out of shows and I think that going to Canada is kinda to extrem just to wach Naruto Shippuden can you please just let us wach all the other contres shows has to offer

"After update, all the sudden apps crash so bad. Please fix it immediately!"
"for some reason Netflix doesn't play when I'm connected to my school wifi??? I have a Galaxy Note 8 ,,,, just asking for help????"
Its been 2 days now that I cannot open my netflix account. It keeps saying cannot connect even my internet is stable
I installed the app today but it won't start It tells me to choose a google account to start with but when I skip that part the whole app is closing
Often having problem with opening downloaded files. data wasted as have to download it again and again
"My account keeps buffering and I've never had that problem i already cleared my cache, restsarted my internet as well as the app it still buffers üòí"
App is very good üëç but an error keep occurring. That doesn't let the app open Error code is (- 1023)
"I think im gonna terminate my subscription. You guys clearly see that theres a problem with smartphone users, and still you refuse to fix it."
"Y'all need to cycle some old junk out here, there isn't going be anymore more Netflix and Chill at this rate y'all are getting passed up by Disney+ & Thrust as well as Hulu and Snu-Snu. Also you very close and closing runner up is HBO GO & Blow. Y'all are gonna end up falling all the way off the cloud stream & cream wagon if ya dont pick up them feet!!!! so grab your crunchy rolls pick a hole and just send it brotha's whatever happens happens and itll be all good haha‚úåü§üü•êüï≥üï≥üï≥üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëàüëâü§úü§úüåäüêà"
"Wish you had more Arabic and hindi series,drama,horror,action too many romances.. Otherwise it's great!"
Well Netflix is cool nice ya I like it but I only downloaded Netflix to watch camp cretaceous and it doesn't let me to watch like I search it but still it does not bring it
The reason i dont really like netflix is bwcause they dont have any of tge good movies anymore they keep taking good shows and movies out and putting bad movies and shows
"Good shows but alot of them are missing dubs/subs and or dont have all the sesons, also due to Disney+ disney movies like mulan keep getting removed wich sucks."
Because i already have Netflix on my tv i think that you should be able to just put you email in and link to your account on Netflix from the tv because we people dobt have a lot of money you know
It really good but when I want to see a show I haven't watched in awhile I can't find it anymore and it makes me mad bc I like to much so stop deleting shows
Why can't i download anything while watching downloaded content. Earlier it worked fine but last update changed it
It doesn't have mostly the program or movies up today when you wham to look at a program most of the time you can't find it
I give this a 3 percent because of the prices and its value I think of you just would change it a bit more like $1.99 or just make it idk like why make an app not everyone can enjoy
"Still stuck on sign upüò°, every time i try it fails to validate my card number.. you should fix this!!"
"I find it hard to find movies,series i want to watch specially new ones and the old animes are not uploaded."
I been using Netflix for a while most frustrating part is its autoplay. Auto Play sucks
Good platform. Does not have most of the movies I want to stream. Not even Harry Potter or any Disney movie!
"How do I uninstall netflix?I can't pay nothing for it,unintentionally it got in my phone---by hackers who put stuff in my phone.need immediate reply.Dont just send long rawn out instructions,I'm not computer literate.i need results today.thankyou for customer servicing."
An app that you need a subscription to use should not be ranked in top free apps.... 3 stars cause you got rid of the League.
I can't cast on my Smart TV. I don't see the option to watch the content on the TV through my Smartphone
A lot of the time they leave me hanging. What I mean is they don't have all the seasons and or episodes. And then I have to find them somewhere else.
It keeps on recommending me things which I have recently watched. So annoying and not very smart.
Observed small issue ...audio langauge changes automatically after every resume of content.
Not as good quality of movies as in the UK. Why we cant get the same movies in the USA as in the UK is just ridiculous ..
"Guys, my frnds having great experience but with me in my tablet video not showing only audio is coming. (Very bad experience)"
"Hello,i have an acount wiTh my 3 frnds,i hve used it for more than 2 months,bt nw my app is not opening,its showing error,plz help me with this"
Offline downloads fail after i update to Android Pie. Uninstalling and reinstalling did not help!
"Technical 5/5, Policies, 3/5, Marketing 0/5. To get adverts for mobile games on an app that you are paying for every month: Priceless."
"Whenever I go to watch a series, it takes a long time to load, and it takes a long time to load, please fix this problem."
I don't like the new update there is no section for available language in series or movie.... I really want it please put this section.....
lot of movies i really want to watch or trendy is not available in the region....is there any way that will let us watch them
When you look for Hindi latest movies then you find nothing because mostly latest content not in Hindi and limited movie content.without Hindi can't cover Max Indian viewers
Can you please give more payment options its quite difficult to take debit card on every month and everymonth its saying coudnt update your payment. Fix that please
Same as what the other review states. Audio keeps on playing but the video is not.
Yo I want to watch dem movie but I have to upgrade...it sucks...but the app is cool ...coz I have an opportunity to watch movies I like
"My downloads have stopped playing. I have reset the settings, restarted my phone, but nothing seems to work"
I think this app is great but some of the movies I was looking for isn't in Netflix.That is why I rated üëå stars.üë®‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª
App keeps stopping inmediately after opening. please help. It shows error message
"Boring, Netflix doesn't have dragon ball z. Some movies missing, latest season of blacklist missing...."
"It's alright, but it uses up all my battery even while phone is idle and app not used for weeks."
It was great i could watch my favorite anime but ot umm loading it takes a while to go back even at the best parts it wont let me watch ......
Wherever i try to watch something it's always shows loading but it never loads can you please resolve this issue of mine.

"Used to love Netflix now its going woke its gonna go broke, these people pander to a few loud woke lefties and slap the vast majority in the face. Do these companies even understand real people ü§î Disney Netflix going woke well let's see what happens, because people the silent majority are saying enough is enough."
Love the app but it would be help ful if it was easier to differentiate from the videos I have watched and those I haven't
I would put 5 stars but I took away one because not all shows are on Netflix and the other because whenever I download a movie not instantly delete idk why
It's pretty good but there's a ton of shows that has less seasons and episodes then it's supposed to.
Pls. put an outline on subtitles. Can't read them when the background is also white.
This app is entertaining but... Some of season deaspear at this point the channel will always change every country when you are in
"Ace app, really good looking but imo a lack of comedic humour, and generally speaking the originals have a weak direction."
It keeps saying error everytime I open the app and try to watch something and it makes me restart the whole app before I can watch it
"Help me here netflix, can't get my subscription done shows eror 404. Did it for a few 30min but its saying the same thing again and again"
I like Netflix. But why is the aerie Supernatural on Netflix in other countries but here in RSA we don't have it? Why don't you just use one platform like YouTube. We ARE paying for it
"it would be great if you guys can add more video controls like: speed, quality etc"
3 star just for the limitations in app. Please introduce watch party integrated and Split screen option if we are watching on cell phone
"New update sucks. Why do I have to click ""Skip review"" and ""Skip intro"" EVERY. SINGLE.TIME now? Please change it back."
Allow exiting the app without having to select a profile. It's on the TV when accidentally selecting netflix.
Please fix the connection issue...it always say can't connect to netflix!EVEN THOUGH I HAVE GOOD DANG INTERNET!im sick of it just please
Decent. Kind of expensive for limited good movies and even fewer good shows.
My multi window has been working on and off with the app its recently started happening I hope it gets fixed.
"Netflix use to be good with shows like family, Simpsons, and Santa Clarita diet all got taken off of Netflix or canceled and replaced with boring shows and movies that are bland"
It okay could have better shows an little expensive for the crappy shows that some of them u cant even understand but it still has those few good shows
"Nothing will play since last update? You need to uninstall, then reinstall and sign back into your account."
"There are so many errors in the Netflix, sometimes the movies and animae are not coming or showing"
I'm not able to watch some recently streaming serieses.. I kept searching but no result at all.. I don't know why it is happening
Its good but they take to long add the rest of the seasons of a show that came out a long time ago like fairytail and hunter x hunter.
its a great app but its slow at night and they NEED!!!!! to get more shows like plz plz plz add annebelle creation and other vool ones
Raises prices every year it seems. Cancels good shows. Takes a year to get a show after network has completed
"from past one week, the app keeps on getting corrupted.... have to uninstall and reinstall again and again....."
It's great just wish u would add.pokemon sun and moon back
Does anyone else have a Samsung a50?? If so are u having trouble watching shows/movies?? I can go into my account play a movie I can hear it but I can't see anything but a black screen..
Very tired about old movies and series
Sad you have to buy certain movies after people purchase the app. ü•≤
There is always a casting problem with anycast and does not work with Moto e 3 power too.
Video is laggy when I skip intro
I see the rating of like in percentage on my lap top but no rating on my tablet or my cell phone
Please add 2 step verification for netflix.....
After changed my password I can't login.always show incorrect password and too many login attempts try again later (-56) this error shows
It's great for binge watching things and also other stuff but I feel like there is only one good Netflix original every year otherwise it's just American high school drama shows
lagy app and video quality not good
It worked great until this last update. I don't know for sure if it's the network my tv or my phone.
I loved it but the series I've love to watch over and over again was taken off a while back and I was kinda of cause of it.
I can't play any of the gta titles via Netflix >:(
"It's decent, the content keeps getting removed and added and I don't know when I'm able to watch it."
"Couldn't really but with prepaid load < Philippines 149php, the only option is Postpaid and not prepaid, I'll make this 5 when the prepaid option is added :D"
3 because when I open a drama that I really like its going back and back
Works well but eats up battery life in the background. Need to force stop it often.
it keeps coming up with errors and always asks me to re-open the application so when I do it doesn't work
"It Doesn't work that smoothly which it did a few months ago, lots of bugs. Please do something on this regard"
"Have more movies to watch and shows :)! Maybe add ""My hero academia""! That would be amazingggggg!!! and totally would rate 5/5"
The quality of Netflix documentaries is deteriorating....
Well now I can't search anything nor see my recently watched list :/
Bug is there if you are trying to turn off the captions it's still showing..
Idk but im watching then the screen went black as in but there has subtitle on it and i dont understand why i check may acc but then i saw that the nxt billing is on dec 5 so i guess i pay the bill properly so dissapointed whats haaaapppeeennniiing? üòë

I can't even play downloaded TV shows or movies. It will only play if it is not saved so we use our data...
Just barely any good shows or movies
The video is going not good kindly update
"This app doesn't working, can you guys solve this"
Can somebody tell me how to turn off brightness adjustment
Works pretty well till it gives you non stop error that's you need to reinstall to make it work.
Its ok. One thing im not getting. Why does it freeze up?
Its a great app but they should rename the slogan scroll more watch less other than that could just find better suggestions.
Smart downloads keep freezing
Good but having Doctor Who back on here would be so amazing!
I think that removing the vampire diaries and The Reputation Stadium Tour from Netflix is outrageous
The only thing i downloaded this cause of the Minecraft: story mode but where did it gooo!!!!!!?!?!!! üò≠ Please bring it backüò≠üò¢üò≠üò¢üò≠üò¢üò¢üò≠üò¢üò≠üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®üò≠üòÆ‚Äçüí®üò£üò£üò£üò£üò£üò≠üò≠üò≠ü•∫ü•∫üò≠ü•∫üò£üòÆ‚Äçüí®üò¢

I have a brightness problem on my Samsung m30s in Netflix
Netflix has great movies and stuff but I hate that they take away good movies for kid shows and how bright the light is that is why my review is 3.0
I keep having a problem with my Acc but everything else is gud
Very top app to watch movies
three stars only because they took off The Originals. thats final.
Would've been 5 star if the beyblade metal series wasn't removed
Netflix can you pretty please bring season 1 to 5 of visitors pleas
The problem with Netflix is when they come in with lgbtq in most of these children's movies or shows and if kids who don't know about lgbtq should have their parent tell them about what it is when it is the right time. But everything else is just good besides the part of there isn't always good content.
"It's only a three stars, why? In Home Alone a guy LITTRELY SAID A BAD WORD. Unless you delete that I will keep the stars"
Please I beg you. Return the Minecraft Story Mode Series BOTH Season 1 and 2 for a five star review.
Hello Netflix i would recommend you guys to start the option of payment procedure in Africa country through mobile banking we in tanzania use Mpesa Tigo pesa etc if this would let us pay through the mobile banking it wouldn't be hustle of paying through someone else's credit or debit cards
I can not view and watch my downloads when offline and even online
"Please help in error 1001 that is "" we could not reach Netflix's server""....... My internet connection is good then also... Please help"
"Netflix is good but you took off the shows that literally everyone loved like family guy, American dad, and many more!"
"Periodic 5.10 errors when playing, unknown cause, including on downloaded content, making the usability experience much worse"
It was great. Now after the last update i cant watch on my mobile in horizontal mode. Please fix it
"The video quality can be better, with high speed internet it shouldn't be at 720p, it should be full HD of 4k"
Sometimes my recently played gone and unable to find it. It happened more frequently these past few weeks.
Please add the bottom sheet to see movie/series information it was good not navigating through screen just to see some info and please add year filter
It‚Äôs not your imagination ‚Äî Netflix doesn‚Äôt have as many movies as it used to Not a great experience as user.
"good content spoilt by picture judder because of wrong frame rate, when are you going to give Android auto frame rate so i can ditch Apple TV?"
"I would say it's good at viewing, but most seasons of things that have already come out are not there like haikyuu, season 3 & 4."
It should be better if there will be an option of filter content by languages.
Netflix is grate it has all things u coold walch like the walking dead that was the best movie ever im a big fan and ther are a lot of movies ... mack more sesons of the walking dead pleas lol
"Whats the point of posting season 4,5,6 without season 1,2,3? Its not like u gt the latest seasons available and no reason for me to start watching that series from the middle of the seasons"
"doesnt work well, download stops automatically, needs to retry many times."
pls add back minecraft story mode
Why don't you add fast forward or Playback speed option in the app. Will give 5 üåü once you get that feature.
it freezes every once and awhile i update it but if that doesnt work restart your device after you updated it
Was working fine until with this new update I can't add movies and shows to my list on my account.
"I can't read subtitles in white videos, please make some borders on subtitles to make it visible in white videos."
Last two updates have not uploaded properly onto my Sony Xperia L and have forced me to uninstall and reinstall the app both times.
I wish you can update your payment option for those who doesnt have cc. Such as payment with phone credit!
This streaming service is kinda good but it gets boring overtime.. There is hardly any good movies or series.. I'm getting to hate this app.
I love the K dramas but you need to put in a feature that lets me know if a show had English dub WITHOUT HAVING TO PLAY AN EPISODE TO CHECK AUDIO SETTINGS.
Its so annoying that your paying monthly and yet some movies arent even available in south korea. Come on Netflix!
Old movies repeated content the functionality of the app is great user friendly but stale content

Crashes frequently and often has black screen forcing you to restart your phone.
there is some good films but there all 4 years or older the rate they put things out it is so slow .
I can't download the app. Checked everything. Other apps are being downloaded but not Netflix
Amazing but it takes the movies a long time to reach up to me and I dont get notice when a new movie has been released
u can only play it on one screen other wise it's pretty nice to watch your show or movies on it for the whole family
Did you guys remove the genres list? It's so much more inconvenient to find shows to watch now.
What is the purpose of having multiple profiles but you can only watch shows one at a time. VERY AGGRAVATING!!!!!
"Great job Netflix you just deleted 1 season of my favourite Pok√©mon show which is sun & moon,if you bring them back I'll give you a better rating - if your reading this I swear to god please bring back the 3rd season"
The new update doesn't allow me to cast to the TV. Islt is not as good a lay out as it use to be.
"Very nice app, hoping that once we download movies to this app,it will save directly to our phone not just into the app.Thanks."
I love that there is alot of shows and movies but I think that you guys can like maybe make the app free for people who don't have a credit card or who don't have money
Please move the cast button back to the bottom. We are lazy and do not like having to stretch our fingers that much
"When i play a video its show black screen, only audio plays, there is a error in video play..plz fix it"
Anyone else has the issue of netflix not letting through phone call rings? So annoying. Cant watch on phone when expecting a phone call...

"Still no HDR support for the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G. Please update this, Netflix and I will update my rating."
Need more movies that have English on them. Mainly on the horror movies. And need to change up on the horror movies more oten.
Everything is fine except for the fact that every time I try to watch something it randomly restarts my phone. I don't know what to do.
Good buts needs more setting options to change Aspect ratio as the camera on the Samsung galaxy s10plus is in the way :(
Just updated on my phone. The new layout is the worst. Change it back to the original grids.
"too many movies are not in collection movies which are top rated should be there on Netflix,not satisfied with this app."
"The app is throwing some error, everyday I have to reinstall the app back. It's frustrating!"
its good but its always say there a problem with playing the video! or i cab hear sound playing in the background but no image
fullscreen mode is interferring with the navigation buttons of the tablet in newer updates. wery annoying
It's okay to watch some movies but it's very limited and gets boring and puts boring shows on.
The application always crash after using it. We always remove and install it again.
"Forward button missing, which is pathetic to skip scene sometimes."
it is great but it needs more good anime like narto shipopined and more one peice but other than that i think net flex is a great app.
"Donno whats the reason but this mofo app suddenly gets an error and app gets closed and restarts from the beginning, all my downloads also gets deleted"
"I love the movies but, Ninjago seasons are missing! All i have is 4 seasons. Rise of the snakes, hunted, sons of garmadon, and march of the oni. Where are the others?!"
Really liked the app until recently when I keep getting the error code 5.10 and have to force stop the app every 30 mins
"The shows are good but not everyone here in India have visa or master card ,if you could update any other form of payment it might be good"
"The app doesn't allow me to sign in despite the credentials being correct, it worked in the browser."
This app is amazing but why do they take movies off and how to train your dragon 2 isn't on and I would like for it to come back
"the app suddenly stop working and no matter what i did, it would not take any p ayments i put it which was totally crazy."
i would really love if you could put the harry potter movies on netflix as well as the fantastic beasts movies.
They don't have that much movies or shows especially horror. The ones that are decent u take off like what the
Hoping they could modify the rating section for the watched movie. Instead of just thumbs up and down.
After the update my PIP seems not to be working. Everything is fine other than it. Look into it. My device : MI A3
"Maybe more than 90% of the titles are rubbish, but with the little slice left you can find hours of entertainment"
Whenever I go to my friends and see there Netflix account they have some movies or shows that I don't have and they use the same region
"Hello. There is no payment option for debit cards, I hope u update it. Then most of all can use it"
How come I cannot open with mobile data. Please inform how can we open with mobil data since I traveling a lot. Thank you
"A great app, the age ratings are not always accurate to the content but over all it is a good app."
Lately when Ive been watching Netflix on my phone and I keep getting ads and there getting on my nerves why is this happening
No online payment like FPX option have to fill card number and other detail just make it easy to use... Movie is awesome
"The new layout is difficult to comprehend. Earlier continue watching was on first page, now shifted to 3rd page."
I use Google pay for several of my subscriptions but unfortunately it is currently not an option for Netflix.
Sometimes the movie or series I want to watch are not available on Netflix but all over it's good and cheap.
They hardly update movies so your watching the same sort of things and the personal profile of each user isn't that good
Love Netflix but after the last update it now mutes my volume no matter if Im trying to turn it up or down.
Everything good but you should devide language it's very hard to find Hindi language content
Last update messed up all. Getting proxy error always Spoke with customer support and they still working ‚òπÔ∏è
not getting good reception I thought it was running off my data but I guess it's just running off Wi-Fi
"I deleted it and re-downloaded it and it keeps telling me ""Netflix is not in service error (-182)"" how do I fix it?"
"Meets Most Expectations except Genre ..just because I watch 1 horror film, Black film, Comedy, Animation doesnt mean I want them ALL."
Lots of loading error. When i start a episode from where i end it last time. Sometimes its restating my phone
Why does my Samsung A50 does not support HD resolution? And on my research it has L1 security. Please do add Samsung A50 for HD support.

"Well, for me I have it on my TV and it works on all my devices except for my TV and it works for others, and I really need to know why it won't work on my TV"
"I own a Samsung Galaxy S20FE 5G and tho my phone supports HDR10+ Contents , Netflix HDR10 support is not available and my phone is on Android 12. Sad."
I have been trying to change my Netflix plan but i couldn't change because change option is not available. Can you please help me.
please add speedup trick overall nice UI but can you give an option where we can speed up videos
"Download stuff everyones already seen, like, last year? What would I do without netflix? Watch bum shows on TV or get TV reorganised especially."
The shows that are on aren't fully updated when they are on going but the quality is pretty good
The new layout in the mobile app is TERRIBLE. Way harder to browse for something to watch.
After the recent update i vew everything with a yellowish shade where as when i drag the status bar i see the colours right why is this happening?
"Have an option to remove the whole mobile games push, not at all interested and feel really it cheapens the Netflix service"
It's a great app but it says add free but I cannot even get through a show without a million ads popping up
Not a bad streaming service but it chews through data. The price is also a little high
Latest update makes playback glitchy when seeking using the -/+ 10 seconds button.
Unble to logged in from one of my phone vivo s1 pro. Talked to support twice but they were not able to fix the issue.
Tried to open the application but the application is closing everytime. I don't know what is happening.
"How do you cancel and remove this from phone, cannot uninstall the app only disable. Taking up too much space"
"why do USA users can watch more series and movies than other countries' users? I think that's unfair, could u expand the catalog for us??? I'll really appreciate that"

"well i got a issue that Everytime i resume it starts from way back like 20,30 min back from my the point were i left it fix that everything else cool"
I dont like the fact that the downloaded videos have expiry dates despites the large amount of data used in downloading them.
Cant search what i want to due to not able to connect to netflix error message but other than that i can watch what they suggest
i love Netflix its a great place to watch shows and movies but i do think rhey should add more shows like teen Wolf or gravity falls
It was the best app but some time ago the screen seems to stuck again and again üò≠ please Netflix fix thus bug
I love netflix it's on my ps5 but right now it's not even installed because it's been stuck on installing for a hour and i cant even press cancel üòê
"It's all good but they don't have quality adjust features like 480p, 720p or 1080p that's brother me alot"
Quality and content is very good but it cost much to less many countries where average income is low adjust your premuim as per country's economic condition
"More than half of the shows are mediocre, bad quality sometimes but besides that great app."
Videos don't start from the time of last viewing so I have to manually move to the latest viewing point.
Video quality is horrible and laggy. Love Netflix but this makes it hard to enjoy.
There is always problems with the app it's stops showing me let's say the movie and just showing black screen it keeps doing it all the time l I have Huawei p30 pro
Content is good but it does not work many time showing error. I am not able to use due to error.
Good app although it would be nice the have more subs than French available on anime in a country with three national language pls do something about this thx im advance
No audio lag for me I don't know what these peeps are talking about but you say it's free but you charge $10 a month
"Its so disspointing, it keeps lagging. I already tried uninstalling it and installing it. But still the same."
No Cast icon. Linked to Chromecast in Google Home. Tried everything and still nothing.
Since the last update I can no longer watch anything in my phone. I have a Samsung...please fix asap!
Love it however it needs a language filter. Some movies I'd love to watch without the swearing.
"In movie option, after preview if back option used , app will show movie list from beginning of app instead last search causing user to scroll once to last search"
Netflix in entertaining but other movies that are not originally from netflix are very behind and nice series are not here like Legacies and game of thrones etc
It keeps crashing on my mobile. I don't know what the problem is. Most of the time it says that I have to restart my phone. I wish I didn't have to do that.
It was good but now it keeps crashing and sometimes the loading screen freezes
"It keeps giving me error unable to play video, then logs me out of the app, forcing me to sign back in constantly"
"App continued to send notifications despite having ""allow notifications"" turned off in the settings."
"there are hundreds of shows but i cant seem to find ""the flash"" seris and i tryed a vpn so can you please realease more seris in a bigger varity of countrys."
When im watching it on my android it sometimes replays back a couple episode or 1. Then when I watch it on my tv everything is fine.
Need to get rid of the brightness control. It keeps the screen too dark!! üò†
Buggy and inconsistent to cast to a TV. Only redeeming be quality is occasional exclusive content
Please put the old subtitles coz it's really hard to see the subtitles if the screen is white and the subtitles is white I feel like dizziness
Great app. Just wish more Up to date movie selection is all this app needs. Then I'll rate it 5 Star.
Netflix should have passwords for profiles. This is the most required feature!
The vpn and account sharing protections also block legitimate use. My kid was in the hospital for a week and we could not watch Netflix on the hospital wifi due to to this. Not cool.
It's all good but I can't watch it in my projector it's connecting but I can see pictures only voices
So annoying it glitches and move to next episode by itself sometimes or when I zoom to fill screen it accidentally move forward
I can't download anything 98% then it stops. Now I can't even stream.. it's so slow and ahh it's a lot
Please add split screen or option to resize popup. Popup is good but we prefer multi tasking now a days.
"Seems to be different than before, almost darker and smaller but that could be the device that i watch it on"
It's good but I wish it had more better horror movies and TV shows on it. I wish the Simpsons were on netflix
Its ok but its boring now theres nothing new to watch now and for the kids its real boring all the good stuff is on the adults side.But other than that its good.
Hey bro.. what happened with samsung s21 ultra February 2022 patch.. after we update the patch.. we can't play the movie again...Any Solutions ?
It's pretty awesome actually but love to see more south Indian language movies including Kannada many of them will like absolutely!
In my phone your app is not opening there's some technical issue (-88) are showing again n again pls help me to short out this problem
"My experience has been, not very good. But pymt is in bank the 3rd of every month.the movie stops and starts over."
Downloaded videos suddenly stops and some translations are incorrect.
"Watch it at home it's a TV station like to watch it now. Netflix all the way , great shows on it."
Also its keeps freezes and It keeps making me go back a couple of episodes and it's really getting annoying please fix it
"Netflix is Good but tamil dubbed English movies is low compared to amazon prime and jio movies app. Netflix charging 499 per month, but prime charges 999 for 1 year and jio cinema app is free for jio users."
My account was hacked from someone in Venezuela. My email and bank card information stolen and used. The best they can tell me is will refund the amount within 30 days and you should change all of your passwords get a new email address and cancel your bank card. They should probably work on some better security for their customers!
Would have given 5 star ‚≠ê but due the poor app app which has crashing issue and unable to play few videos without a reason ask you to wait like forever
Blueray popular are on a crawl. No issues in past but Rambo and Richard Jewell and the last Bad boys was about 5 months wait. Then unknown movies I didn't put in my que week after week. I get 2br at a time unlimited lots are dropped off by usps to get ones quicker.
I LOVED the app the reason I gave little stars is because it keep crashing and babbling about error 1001 or something..soo it ruined my moods :(
app is working good but movies and TV shows are lacking hulu is starting to be my go to place Netflix needs to do better
Not a fan of the brightness bar on the screen. If we could turn it off that would be great
It's very slow on the home page when you try to scroll through the different movies and not just on my phone
This app is so great and is a mega. Cause I watch latest movies and videos on Netflix and is so exciting.
"the app is good with many good tv shows and movies but the it is a bit pricey ,if price reduces its worth it"
Great app just needs better and more options to choose from like original series harry potter for example or maybe the percy jackson series stuff like that and more anime thats all i gotta say lol
"will you pls put obey me,high school musical 1,2 3 and teen beach movie 1 and 2. Thank you.Then about my expirience it fine but there some movies that are no where to be found and i guess that the price could be lower even like 10-20%, thats all thank you."
It's skips a lot and the audio still plays while the movie is stuck in one spot
There is continous issues of videos or movies getting blurred or there are some congetions in playing any series or movies on my device
It's ok until you find out that they don't accept G-Pay or other forms of paying thru apps i think they should change That
Good app but not all shows show in my country even though I pay the full amount. Which is ridiculous
It is a good app but it needs a lot of internet but I have a little bit of internet be cus I I'm not Rich that is why I'm going to rate this a 3 so if you're going to get it mack shore it is good üëçüòä
"Nice app, good for entertainment, it would be better if it includes more of local movies and series too"
Make 2x play speed available & i will give 5 stars for this app for sure. 1.5x speed is too damn slow!
Netflix is a shell of wgat it used to be its decebt at best it doesnt have the good shows like it used to and thats the most dissapointing part
Its nice but It would be better if login athunication is improved which can be done via otp as well as password at the time of login
I wish they had all the movies but they don't have many tv shows for example young sheldon and they has so many series with not all of the episodes
"Not so good, recommend already seen movies, search for perticullar movie never show right results."
"good content, but possibly the worst UX and cataloguing of any app. Really amateur."
"There is a bug in continue watching, it doesn't go well, it doesn't show my latest watched series, that i continue to watch them"
There's a problem I can't seem to access the new & hot action on the app for upcoming shows & movies.
"I hve been watching netflix for almost a year,. It's good but expensive and new contents are take time to come"
Really bad recommendations. It would be okay if there was an easy way to browse content - it is not.
All my downloads are not playing. Giving me the 5.7 error. Doesn't help to refresh device as advised. Not happy
I love Netflix because there is a lot to watch but sometimes I can't download videos.
Ill hit add to my list in the app then it will say added and switch back to the plus sign and say error adding to list?
"Up until now, you've been spot on Netflix. Also wondering and worried about this latest update if all the last update did was mess up the app?!"
Hasn't got any older TV series
It's great realy... I'd just like it more if there where more of a selection and had some older shows on it like Sons of Anarchy and The Office...
Was working perfect since update now I'm having problems with my list I can't add or remove films or programs anymore
Seems to work okay but it causes the Chromecast to glitch when using subtitles...
"Although it's a great app, I think it's not right to upload movies in regards about people's religion don't you think? Isn't that why we have freedom of religion? Even though it's ""for fun"" I think it's not right to change a certain religion just for the sake of entertainment and wealth. Also, please don't make fun nor change any facts or history in relation to religion just for your amusement. I hope you will think this through for the religious beliefs out there. Thank you"
u should add all 328 episodes of fairy tail on this app. I'm kinda disappointed that u only put 100 episodes of my favorite anime. I'll give 5star if u put that.
i like Netflix alot but I hate how much it costs. also it is constantly buffering.
I can hear my shows but I cant see them. When I'm wanting to watch a show on my phone i can hear the show but i cant see it.
Recently I have updated my app and it's works worst I m neither able to download my video nor the videos play from the point it left
Takes a while to download and it has kicked me out of the app a couple times i had my email and password right but it still didnt let me in im downloading it again but idk what it well do
They take all tge good shows away like family guy and american dad. And there are so many adds. Thats why I watch Hulu. Buts an ok app.
"Cant see the subtitles especially when watching anime, the subtitles need an outline."
Too many ads on tablet. My phone doesn't do it at all. Both are Samsung products
Netflix is cool but it would be great if you guys can introduce substitles or English dubbed version of Korean dramas.
im so impressed with this app.. everyone of us enjoying much watching.. but we suggest to upload more movies and when we search movies what we want should have there.. thank anywayüòä
"The downloads CONSTANTLY keep failing to play, even if I uninstall and reinstall the app, or restart my phone"
totally awesome. except when I read reviews then it's in another language.
"Please fix the subtitles for Netflix on Android tv, it too big i can't barely watch the movie or series"
What is going on with the Netflix it's not working nothing is showing up.. smh I pay for this please fix the problem
The downloads that I have keep going blank even though the epidode or movie is still going on but otherwise it's pretty good :)
Wrong age ratings Netflix has a lot of shows that are TV-PG based but its actually a show/movie for 13-16 year olds.
"After update when playing movie auto rotation not working nor other button like Play ,pause, 10sec forward, nothing working"
"Everytime I open up this app, have to uninstall and re-install it. Could be my ancient lenovo tablet tho. Surely it's pretty cool üòä"
Hey Netflix. Awesome app but can you please not use Jesus's name in the program. You do not use Buda's name or any other religion's God's name. So please leave it out.
Can you let us connect our downloads from phone to laptop? It was just such a waste of data not being able to watch it on a larger screen
App no problem but most of shows are dark and no way to brighten up please fix it.
"I would give it a five but most of the time I can't even get on the app, it tells me to sign in to Google and I choose my account but it won't let me in."
The payment method is a mess...why cant you guys introduce a mobile banking payment method ...a credit only for netflix is really unnecessary üíî
It randomly takes me to the home screen so i have to enter the app again and it happens each time i tap an object or go back
"They are taking off old videos in exchange for unwanted ones, they do not recommend similar videos to the previous ones the users watched"
There is no Famous English dub Anime are available only sub available it's very bad I subscribed because of whach new Anime but it's to bad I'm not sure it's Netflix subscription is value for money ü•≤
Always glitched. Fix it. The recommendation are not always suitable with my taste. My phone: Google pixel 2XL
"""household"" update makes it awkward for partly broken families. Otherwise was a 5 star. :)"
"I'm passionate about media and entertainment, and I'm drawn to Netflix's unique approach to creating and sharing content with its customers."

"Netflix always wants me to update. Error says ""woud not reach Neflix service."" I DONT KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO. IM A BIG FAN OF NETFLIX BUT I KEEP GETTING ERRORS, I JUST DONT KNOW URGH."
"Had a problem where i couldnt watch anything, kept saying that this title wasnt available, but for everything."

It os good but when a new season of something comes out it dosnt come out on netflix and i really do think when a new season of something comes out i think the should put it in qick because many people want to whatch it sooo ueah thats all other tjen that ot is good
Good content but very expensive to watch on TV. You should reduce prices like 200 monthly for all devices
Constantly pauses while watching a video to buffer even when the show is already downloaded
I always have log in and log out problem. Even after changing the password it still cant log in.
Its ok. But its all getting old. Theres not much i want to watch on here now. New content turnover is pretty slow. Yawn.

Good except tjey need to organize the categories better. I don't like foreign films dubbed with poor acting voices
I don't like your apps interface tbh. Not ergonomic at all. Previous on is better tho. Here's 3 stars
Automatically the app logged me off and when I try to logged in it shows too many login attempts and error.
It's good but it says that I am using vpn or a proxy even though I'm not so I can't watch other shows that I want to watch.
If you could be able to set in search a way you get to know the person who is using your account and be able to kick him off without changing password then I'll give you 5 star
"Cannot sign in any device, I already insert the correct email and password but still erorr. Please fix this problem."
Dear Netflix take your stupid update back .... Your not Instagram when you get too comfortable with the app you mix mix mix .... But since your taking money from viewers stop being useless update it's the atleast you can do

"Why I cannot watch some of the movie, specially some of episode in the series..?? Really need help to fix this problem."
Service is good but the service that people are providing sucks . They don't pay for our Netflix they don't pay for the Internet they have no say on to who gets to share what . Honesty there making money regardless so stop screwing with people who are actually trying to work to pay for this. Leave our account alone. And or fix the error on these people who think they have the right to get in anyone's business.
"Sometimes, a show only is in there when you watch from your tv,but not on there if you watch on another device."
I think more user will use this app if there are lot of payment methods aside from debit/credit cards and postpaid. Try to add gcash or just allow us to pay using google play store
i found so hard to play the movie. sometimes always loading and error notifications pop up to my phone
Uninstalled due to recent policy changes. There are also not enough new contents to keep the subscription.
"It's a good app, except they keep removing or canceling actually good shows like the order."
Otherwise a solid app but the errors when I open are annoying and only leave if I reinstall the app multiple times per day
"Lately been experiencing ""Error in adding to List"" and it's exasperating."
The latest update has left it useless on my phone. Now i can't watch it anymore here...well i don't know how to. Not happy at all
It's a good app but seems like I'm always updating this app. Which takes more room on my phone and thats annoying.
There would be nice if the movies had trailers. Apart from the short description. And a more diverse filtering options.
Content are very good but There is no search option with language .
Most of the time showing an error when you try to open the app. Unable to login due to that error.
Why on earth when I'm connected to a Chromecast in the app does it start playing on my phone?! Sort it out

I can't open the app... it's says... they can't open the app.. I have to install it and again install it..then I can watch..so annoyed
The only issue is they need to get new seasons for shows like the flash and supernatural out quicker
I mean yes i know you watch like movies and that bit I think it could be a little more cheep. 1. expensive 2.poor quality 3.not meany good kids moovies
I like how theres no ads but u gotta pay (looking at u hulu) but i wish they had a thing where u can change ur location without a vpn i wanna watch anime dammit other then that its awsome
Plz give option for feedback or rating for each movie and webseries individually so that viewers can predict it is good or wastage of time
I never had a problem wit the app til now. The screen is dark and it's only in the app.
They took alot of my favourite shows off or didnt finish off alot of the series's but other that that it would 5 stars!! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü
"Dunno why recently when i open one movie, the resolution become dimmer. Not clear. Please adjust"
It consumes more data than expected... There's no adjustment of picture quality like other apps
"They have made cheap sub 720 resolution, on TV it looks like a old school Nintendo game. I THINK CHEAP SUB IS TARGETED FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT HAVE MOBILE PHONES?"
Hey Netflix! Please back filter button in app. So then we find easily what we search.

It is nice and perfect app for watching but it would be nice if there would be a yearly plan so for that i gave 3 stars
make your subtittle bigger. Or size options atleast. Its too small. Not everyone has a perfect vision!
"Why suddenly netflix have this problem?? Subtitle is white and harder to read, make me feels headache only to read that..pls fix it asap!!"

"App crashes, unabel to launch the app. Details: Android phone OS 9 Version 7.62.0"

The latest update is so bad the details are so small like it's so hard why do you have to update and make it worse i gave 3 stars because of no laggings i need the old version please!
It's great but downloads take way to much space for like a 20 minute episode. Fix it.
it wont let me get in you and you spend more time looking then watching but they do have good movie that is why i gave it a 3.
Would like to know why I should bother updating the app. The update description is very condescending.
Cant press play after pausing a show . I have to rewind 10 seconds or exit the show and reopen0
I love the app but i think if i swith my storage to my SD card my downloads should run a little faster like when i download movies on my internal storage
It's good and all but they don't put new episodes/movies as quick it takes like a whole year to put in new episodes/movies
Keep picking out the same movie. I like all movies may be in the mood for something else or different

Why can't I watch Netflix over other apps anymore? I can do it with YouTube.this sucks.i don't even up watching most of what I download due to this.

"There are too many bugs, recent watched movies doesn't display most of the times,"
this app is very good but for some reason it keeps saying that i have to restart my device but when i do it the same thing pops up.
The content must be improved since most of Content is late of the current year so I think I should Pay for a service that give me new
"Well, its okay and some movies/shows are okay but, i get bored from a lot of them. Netflix you have a moive called ""cuties"". And its basically sexualizing children in there and, i dont understand why that movie is out for people too see. Like as if pedophiles wont love that..."
Can you please make an English subtitles for all the Chinese movies and series because some of them doesn't have english subtitles.thank youüòá
What happened with netflix.. The app. Suddenly crashes from time to time
"Feel s like your offering less and its costing us more, due to all the extra fees to watch specific shows."
This app is good üëç but you can't watch the latest movie s like when they are released in public we have to to wait a month or 2 for that movie to release.
would of given 5 stars but the search function is now gone on my tablet! i want to search for shows\movies ect!! bring back my search üò§
"Great app, but sometimes i have to uninstall and reinstall which lowers the appeal by quite a bit."
I would like it to be easier to see my recently watched items. They keep disappearing
Library is really small compared to US. The price is still same. Good but not value for money. If you like Horror and you're in India it's got pretty much nothing you'll find for first time.
Netflix is good. It would be better if you put coraline back on. Id apriciate it.
I would have preferred Netflix over Amazon Prime if Netflix also showed the ratings of movies. Bye!
Just recently got an issue where Netflix forgets where in an episode I stopped on or take me back an episode entirely.
"It is nice, but one problem though, i find it annoying when they remove a Tv show while i am not finished."
I give this app three stars because the are very little movies and series to watch. I hope you find this helpful
"The app is so likely, but most hard step is for me is I can't drive it the way I want, some times it may be stopped"
"P20 huawei. The app doesnt load. Please check. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but still didn't work"
"I think this is a very good app b-cause it has nice films and series,literally just 3 stars‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ because it may be so annoying sometimes.But yess"
Still has great movies and shows but the quality of the thing in general has dipped like chicken nuggets every time you see a dipping sauce near you
Lots of issues lately. Saying the title is unavailable and to try again later. Getting tiresome
Whenever I click on something to watch the screens black but the subtitles work so I have no clue whags going on??
"Casting to TV ICON is not present in my device, it would been higher if that issue isn't happening."
"We need more content. I know it is based on the country that you are in and what you have the rights for, however it's getting lame overtime"
I love this app because you can watch lots of things but you have to pay extra to watch on two screens and add more üí∞
Could be way better if they had devs working on improving usability instead of just the AI that maximizes views.
Could use more of a variety of movies and tv shows then Netflix could be better than it is now
Feature requests: add already watched list option ...it will more use full and don't display the movies/web series from already watched list
Sometimes I can't open the app. I still need to update it and try it multiple times to open.
Its good but you need to work on the latest movies and series also TV shows......all except that the app is fine to me GREAT JOB
Most shows I want to watch have incomplete amount of seasons and I cannot choose the quality of a movie
Can I fix how we cant read subscriptions. I dont want to start a movie I wont like because I dont know what its about. Please fix this and i will give 5 stars.
Why was the option to put an access PIN on R rated movies removed? This feature allowed me to approve certain movies and deny others for my kids. It was much easier that way. Please bring this feature back.
Its a good app for fun and movie entertainmentüòÅ just asking if you can Add Mpesa billing to Netflix then it will be a great deal for Kenyans to upgrade
If there is a movie with a second language there is never subtitles for that portion.
takes shows off of netflix without considering if people enjoy it or not and doesnt let me download any more than 5 episodes of something even though i have NO other downloads?
"Please add more variety. More movies and series (latest, bigger, better). Thanks much."
S[ofttimes the movie stops playing and I have to leave Netflix and come back and try to watch something else.
this app is good but there's something I want you to fix like the subtitles its all white I hope we can change it so we can watch the movie clearly
If think this app is awsome but the fact that they get rid of amasing shows like max steel I mean it what a great show why would you get rid of it also for some reson I can't find fullmetal alcamist: brotherhood
i think this app is good but lots of kids used to much like me so i think you should put a time limit on how much you can watch episodes or movies
"App is fine, Netflix just needs to add new movies and tv series quicker."
"My android phone (Vsmart Aris) often has a problem (5.10) when I try to play videos on netflix, please fix it"
I love the show I was watching unfortunately I had medical issues I figured I got bumped out I frankly lost the whole month so as it is I can't get into the Application oh well TV is still the üåü thank you
The content on netflix has gone downhill. With disney gone i dont know if its worth $15 a month anymore.
"Since the latest update, the video frame rate stutters when you have subtitles on."
"Good content, content recomandation system is not good keep suggest same content each time."
Everything is fine but there's a problem that I'm facing right now. I can't watch in app downloaded content. Please help.
"Sometimes downloading process stuck, i was downloading a movie and when it reaches 93%, it's stuck there not downloading"
It would be great if Netflix has offline Mode to not use data on it....
"Picture in picture mode is not working anymore, tried to reinstall/update/clean cache to no avail"
It's an amazing app but some titles that say are available on Netflix aren't at all available
I cannot sign in the app even if I didn't change the password I can't even reset the password or create new account please check it out
"It would be great, except I can't log in. It logs in on my computer fine, but not on the app."
Only 3 starts cause all the countries don't have the same shows like Netflix US is much better than Netflix Pakistan
Not gonna lie Netflix is great but I HATE how the have different shows and movies in different countries Like why can't we have what everyone has?
"Dear Netflix, "" Please update your anime! We love anime to you know!... and we would like all of them with English dub. And the rest of them to."
"Really long to install but this technology is awesome! But, it deletes shows."
"I wish there were more english movies and less dubbing or voice overs, it limits the entertainment, like really, who can watch that?"
I love watching netflix when im bored but im really sad that yall took friends off because it was my favorite thing to watch but please bring it back it would make my day
The app is all good but it would be better if you could remove shows from your continue watching list
"Earlier it was running fine, but i try to update it, it stops at 91%. Please advise what to do."
Was working really good then all of a sudden it starts saying it cant connect to netflix.
lots of bugs when casting.. the program playing on tv the app shows nothing is playing!!
Netflix plans subscriptions are just absurd 649 bucks for just 2 screen .. Atleast we should get 3 screens at that.
Has a lot of reruns. Or you can watch a movie because it has technical . difficulty
Should add a feature where admin should get the privilege to manage other profiles. Also with profile lock and control who can see at a time
I wonder how come dev team not noticed how badly they need to add a SLEEPTIMER!!! ü§î Saving a star for it. Another one for resulation control.
Won't let me see my entire list. Stops letting me scroll after only a few. Please fix this on the app.
"When screen is locked while a video is played ,it starts autoplaying after some time in the background üôÇ"
Entertaining. But the App doesn't show the same shows as the browser.
It's been good so far apart from limiting me not to watch locked series and not releasing season 2of the series raising Dion and it's already out
Good app for watching series but no recent hit movies are uploaded. I have subscribed but totally disappointed.
"First of all, when I tried signing out, there was no sign out button, so I had to unstall and reinstall to log out."
"I'm searching the title of a TV series but it's not showing the series that i looking for, always show on the list is the title related but not the title or tv series that I looking,"
Recently in my phone i can see only subtitles and the screen is black... It sucks!
"the app is not working properly when i go on it ,it says error and when i deleted it and install it back its not logging in"
It was good until now.. suddenly it won't let me sign in and if signed in it signs me out the moment i click on any of the show
Nothing is showing on the screen whenever I pick a anime or a movie just the sound.pls fix it quickly
Needs up to date movies and episodes. They are out too long before Netflix receives them.
I think it pretty good but the reason why I give it is because some movies and episodes you can't watch but other then that it's pretty good üòÄ
"Dear Netflix, the update we have just received, your picture quality is getting a little messy."
"i love netflix, but why cancel naruto shippuden? I already saved it in my reminder, I'm very disappointed because I've been waiting for it for so long."
Good but need options on the screen to turn up the volume as increasing brightness.
"Horrible bs documentaries. Most of the documentaries written from a leftist state of mind. witch I'm fine with if there was more opinions or point of views instead of an echo chamber that ses we dont like god we love murder cults. Like Ted Bundy vs Immigration nation. And what's up with the new release's, what is your definition of new? Get it together Netflix go back to Anime and sifi plz in theory that's what your best at."
"Why my debit card isn't accept for payment...Netflix should add some more payment options like UPI,or other online payment"
"I'm using P20 Pro, there are movies with no video and all I can hear is the audio."
I am rating this three star because when I tried to sign in it kept saying incorrect password plz fix this problem apart from that it is a good app
Initially it was opening correctly. But now a days this app is crashing. Please provide me a solution
Only used it for one piece and has barely any episodes of it. Only about a third of the anime. Am exited for live action though
App is beautiful and fast and awesome but price is very high don't know why even there is no annual plan.
This app keeps asking me for my password And if I put the password correctly it keep telling me incorrect password Please you guys should do something about that.
It is good but there arnt any good movies that i know or are any tyoe of new and the movies just dissapear after a while.
Everything is great... But why this playback speed option has been removed in latest update... Doesn't like that much now
"Hello Netflix i have a request for u.I'm 16y I'm a student.My English is not good.So i want to watch Netflix but idon't have credit card to pay because am to young . My request is that I want to pay through Google. I hope Netflix,will have it soon."
It always asks me who is watching. It's not cool. And right now my app has been loading since yesterday till now. I can't watch any movie. Why is this happening?
"Hey team Netflix you are doing great but I hated one thing so much that there is no movies,shows,anime in hindi language can you please provide us in hindi language otherwise I love Netflix"
It's a good app but the seasons are like a ten year distance before it releases.
"Very good. But there is a limited number of items that can be added to My List (yeah, I have that many). Can you fix that?"
include more heart warming movies too much sci-fi and action content keeps me away from viewing Netflix.
Its great and all but i can't find certain shows such as pok√©mon i can't find it since i updated this app very frustrating üò†üò°
I cannot download and watch simultaneously. Download automatically stops if I play something.
I've been enjoying Netflix until LATELY it's become extremely SLOW and FREEZES up ALOT! PLEASE FIX THIS BECAUSE IT'S VERY ANNOYING!!!!!
I love netflix and the app has been great but recently it's stopped loading and no matter what I try it won't work
Application has not much more content but it have full of adult content . This is Expensive than #Hotstar and many other app like #Amazon prime etc
"It's a good app but i don't recommend since they cancelled ""Julie and the phantoms"". But y'all should watch ""purple hearts"" and ""5 feet apart""."
"Good app to watch movies, but it's getting too expensive. Would be 5 stars if not for the cost."
Works great when they actually have what you want to watch. But most of the time they won't have whatever it is you want to watch.
Okay so I don't know if you are aware that there are many other people who want to do with out the sign up bs you at Netflix make sure that wedo.
"What's going on with the subtitles, they keep defaulting to on! Please fix this."
Doesn't put a lot of supernatural shows you watch them all then you wait a year for the next season.
"Hi.. i would like to uninstall netflix on my phone, but uninstall option is not coming.. it acts like system appü§îüôÑ, any solution..??"
I like Netflix but am disappointed for a streaming service to have regional blocks on content.
"So far, not good, considering i have medium wi-fi and cannot be connected to Netflix"
What the hell ADS on Netflix (started February the 1st 2022). THE reason of my subscription was ininterrupted viewing of shows.
It sucks they promised they would have the new seasons of Heartland on in January and it's not on yet come on already put it on Netflix.
I can't download episodes of my shows because it keeps on saying i have to many downloads on my device when i don't have any downloads at all
great streaming service... just not the right films and its been unable to connect for weeks
Netflix is very good. The only thing I would recommend is to upload the latest movies nd series plsüôè
Device goes to a non progression state after plugging in the charger while watching any series.. Device used: OnePlus 7(11)
ya im on android and when im watching a show or movie the right sode of mg screen got darker i ignored it at first until it made that part completely black if others have s problem with this please look into it
"I rate it with three stars as seasons of certain series e.g. oitnb take a long time to be aired on Netflix, please improve on this..."
I use my friends account but sometimes it can't connect to my tv that's the only problem I got which is not cool
"Overall its good, but keeps stoping in between and display comes device failure occured please try again (500.-117) should we pay for this interruptions"
"Netflix loses all sound...Randomly. I uninstall, install, reboot, etc...Still no sound...Frustrating!"
"it was fine for a while, but now it wont play videos, says theres an error and now won't even let me download it"
"How could they cancel Daredevil, one of their most popular shows! I mean i get disney is coming out with their own streaming service but really, COME ON!"
"ok don't hate me on this one because I just gave it three stars. i was hoping to see im favorite old-time black and white movies but who guess, I guess no one really watches those anymore ""hah"""
I love this app. But there's not as many new movies any more. Iit has more tv shows then new movies.
Not bad But the summery they right for movies or dramas are usually never good. And there isn't a lot of Asian dramas or movies.
Its good but id prefer if you have subscription why you would pay cinema prices for a movie that was just on tv.
Mentioning aired date & year would be one thing which this app needs. It'll make viewers less confusing.
I like Netflix but you guys release movies or seasons late very Very late by the time you released a new season for an anime new seasons come out.
My samsung a20s takes time for me to sign in in netflix.. sometimes it only shows loading gif and then nothing happens..
"Sometimes it doesn't open. I need to do clear data, which causes of deleting the offline contents."
My language preferences are set to English. Titles of episodes are in German though.
I love Netflix no doubt but lately I just cannot updated my payment and it keeps on declining.
The latest UI is the worst experience i am having while using any OTT.
Not able to watch.... payment update option coming and up payment is not working in the app. . It's been 2 dYs .
I am not able to open the app in my Rog Phone 3. It is throwing device failure error from past 3 months. Help me out here
Netflix is a good app but they need to add better shows and movies.
Everything is fine except Netflix yearly plan. I think Netflix should launch yearly plan in India.
"I am also facing some issue in past 3 days, I am not able to play anything on my phone, it keeps on loading if I play any content"
Nice to watch shows... Don't understand the hype for a company that just delivers videos.
well only over last cuple days has my netflix app been closing on me wen i try open it to watch netflix i keep gettin kickd out its really annoying nd frustrating nd weird
Doesn't have all the shows I wanted to watch when I downloaded it. But excluding that it is a great app
This app is good but I can not buy premium because I have an Indian card I would suggest to bring more payment options like upi
"I rated it a 3 stars because not all movies are there like the series ""Ironman Armored Adventures"" only has 2 seasons instead of 3"
"Buggy app When I pause the video and press power button to turn screen off, the app resumes the video with screen off."
New 'Home' layout is a joke. 1 star. Now we're required to slog through a sea of detritus before finding what I want. Rest of Netflix is still 3.5 - 4.
I enjoy my Netflix its too bad they took Charmed off and a few others need more new programs to watch but I loves my Netflix always finds something to watch
"You should add hindi audio on such popular tv shows, web series, movies.... Like van helsing, money heist,lucifer and many more.... Those hindi version are available any webside...... I think by adding hindi audio you can get more people from indian site and some neighbour countries also"
"I had a good experience in Netflix ,its just that we don't get every movie or series here but overall it good"
Doesn't offer very many movies in my genre. Old B movies. Creature features. Not many new releases.
I got bug in moble application.... resume and play will be happen in background... it's Super annoying ....
Good don't lose a lot of data bad you have had Train Your Dragon 1 and 3 but not 2 please add 2 thank you otherwise it amazing thank you
GTA DEFINITIVE EDITION NOT WORKING ON MY PHONE
"Help fix the English subtitles, somehow the word cover with black line and place weirdly at the upper screen which interrupting the view"
"It's alright, but netflix lost a lot of its charm as well as a lot of its tv shows."
"don't know why keep crash when i watch movie and when it happen i need to restart my phone first, if not i was stuck at netflix loading screen"
There is only one thing that i have issue is the HDR it's too black please do something to improve the HDR content
Some nice shows and movies I haven't seen before but most of them are kinda boring or really old.
Screen is very dark i adjusted brightness in app. Barely tell a difference. Tried on other devices same issue.
Absolutely great the reason i demoted two stars was because it dosent have every good show i know of but overall it was a good app.
"TOO Dark When watching I'm using a Android,, and you should finish the story of the episode! You'll see later your going down also because of this unfinish story of episode!"
Its good but not at the same time I pay almost 20$ per month so I had to delete it because I will go poor if I don't.
"the app is good but you must add dragon Ball super , end game ,you can't add end game but you can add no way home"
"sometimes its good, sometimes its so bad. i cant download anything even tho my internet connection was so stable."
Won't save the watching progress. I have to guess where I finished after a few months of not watching.
Brightness does not goes below a level. But it has sufficient level remaining to low down. Why?
"editing my review from 5 to 3 stars, turns out lots of anime and lots of videoes with episodes are lacking, usually season 1.üòë"
"Netflix used to be awesome until they got rid of my favorite show's like (Supernatural, Charmed, ShadowHunters, vampire diaries). etc"
Well i get a chance to watch a few movies and then it says that it's unable to connect try again later.....
Netflix has a lot of movies. The only thing is that it takes like a year for a movie to be on Netflix.
The overly simplfied interface makes it hard to use on this new update i liked the old interface much better
"Sometimes stop and play button doesn't work. To replay, I would watch previous 10 seconds"
Can Netflix please up date the series new seasons.There are few ones that has been released but not updated on Netflix.
Netflix we can see from horror to romantic movies and even the best ones still have at least one thing that you don't like
"Needs more! Bigger selection of 80s 90s movies and old school cartoons, then I can really chill."
The software has a problem. I need to reinstall frequently. Also can't update my payment method.
"3 stars for now. I love watching anime but seems like series are not complete, it lacks a lot"
why doesn't it have all the episodes of flowering heart i know that there is a lot more than that and when can you please put more seasons of it like it is originally concluding other anime's
Why my Netflix maximum playback is SD while in the Netflix website stated my phone model can run on HD?
Good sometimes. App lags like every 5 seconds on my mobile device. Very annoying.
All nice but it's unacceptable that the basic plan (8‚Ç¨/mo for 1 person) still offers a 480p resolution.
"Whenever I resume an episode, it starts to play previous ones. Not from where I've stopped."
"Considering how much you keep jacking up your prices, this app should not be crashing as much as it does! Please fix it!"
Need more English Show less foreign garbage. The price needs to be lowered. Not keep going up for mediocre tv.
Recently I am seeing all the settings in japanese language I am trying settings in english but it becoming diffucult for me as its continuing displaying in japanese content
Actually I really want to ask something I want a free trail for one month then I will install it but it is showing payment methods firstly I want a free trail then I install it
Good app but stopped working for a bit and only let me watch a movie for around 10 seconds then just paused by its self
Netflix good. App bad. Drains battery when casting to Chromecast.
i renewed my membership for 149/month unfortunately the app did not opened i restart my fone sadly its not working.. What can I do? Why is it happened?
"Uhhh this is worst !! There is problem to download or Play video and whenever i download the drama in Hindi audio , when I saw it online it have the Hindi dub but when I download it the Hindi dub was just gone üò©"
Works great but not happy when I have have to pay for it without using the app even once the entire month.
Usually a great app but here recently it is only showing netflix originals and wont let me watch my favorite show (shameless btw)
l love Netflix but for a couple weeks now it keeps freezing giving me an error code.
Subtitles' visibility needs work. I am watching animes like MHA and Blue Lock and the subtitles are barely visible proving it really hard to follow. Hope you can remedy this soon.
Sometimes the app won't open. It gives me a -1023 error code(could not reach service).
"I like Netflix however, sometimes it plays but there is no video. Actually, that happens often."
"The update is amaizing you can now download to watch later but pls unlock all the movies to be free and will give 5 stars, pl s make all movies free."
It is a really good experiance but on some anime the only do one season and it really buhs me cuase it is either the second season is in japenese or there is not even the second season
For some reason sometimes I can't watch things and also if you cant download anything but disable the app then enable it again
"This app is great but my problem is that alot of the anime here is incomplete (like Jojo, sao and mha) and sometimes the app just stops working"
Love the app..would be nice if could add a block scream bottom!! And why can't get all movies in french??
"Recent updated has tags and not descriptions. Also, logging me out a lot. Already uninstalled reinstalled."
I just want to let you know that my account is not responding to netflix although that my account is active in response.
You keep taking shows out and replacing them and that kinda sucks because sometimes I want to rewatch shows.
"Nice I have had some wonderful times with this app, but improvements and more customer friendly reachout plans are expected.üíêüôèüåªüåπüó∫üåêüåçüèï"
Reinstalling the app every week is getting irritating! Other apps are working better right now.
its great but there is a bug right now and i cant even watch or download any shows it will say this title is not available right now
It has been exciting and interesting. Netflix gives me perfect entertainment exactly when i need itüåπüòÅüòÄ
Worked fine but a few month sometime it refuae to open it just says netflix and wont load i have to uninstall it and reinstall
In this app only one problem that is the paid system of subscription is only available for one month please solve this problem
Good app . But plenty of ABC series are not available as well as a bunch of movies
I don't understand why most of the content that's for example available in the US or UK isn't available in my country?
Having difficulties logging in via app or web at times. Already changed password 3 times yet error still persists
Charge is high
I can't read the subtitle as it blends well with white background. Please fix it.
They should really keep all seasons in a show for example the Flash or Arrow that way it will be better than before
"Please add a new payment method such as a mini market or others, don't just use a credit card, it's difficult for some people"
I have only one video in the downloads.but I got notification to many downloaded videos.so I can't download next episode.please fix that issue
I had this app for 1 year now an it is so dry now the content is just disgusting they should take it down NO MORE NETFLIX They should at least have nicer movies an series so that people can enjoy
not liking the new update. series i was enjoying have disappeared. and somethings that were available for download no longer there
For some reason today whenever I start a show my screen goes dark i've tried restarting my phone and force stopping Netflix
Netflix is OK could be great if they would actually put a lot of the peoples request for TV show and movies on her
where has the search option gone and the delete from list if you decide you don't want to continue watching still not loud enough on my galaxy tab
Google chrome stop working. Once update it start again. It pushing it to update the app....
You still have most things I watch gone but I found other things so stop unadding and adding stuff cuz I can't keep finging new stuff to watch every month.
Very good app
üò§ having too much of problem from last two three days ( like not working at all n it shows just a written word üëâÔ∏èNetflix üëàÔ∏èonly ) please do something please üôè
"Excuse my past review, I was a child back then. Pretty good streaming service besides to watch movies. I still hate you guys for thinking of 'cuties' though."
"Great content, but it often freezes or goes blank, but the audio still plays"
Recently no button for brightness modified.. I really can't watch a movie due to the screen is quite dark.. Why was that?
"App not working, app is not opening. Pls resolve the issue as soon as possible."
"I subscribe the premium high quality video from nexflix, why the quality of the picture in my smart view was poor quality.....please fix this problem"
"It is better then a prime video or hotstar the only thing you have to keep a download quality like low quality ,high quality"
Cool movies but don't have some latest movies that im looking for ! So far its been a good experience with this app .
Netflix does not allow me to save downloads to my SD card anymore on my tablet. Please fix this
People say that its a cool app where u can watch movies and shows but it costs money and I don't wanna pay so I'll rate 3 or 2 out of 5
Does not track watched series anymore. Perhaps because watching via Chromecast.
The show's you put on Netflix are so old. Need to have newer shows released. For example the housewives of Atlanta started 10 years ago ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è put the latest season on
I love the app but it just has a couple glitches and it doesn't really have much movies but overall it's good
I moved from s9 to s20 few days ago removed my account from the s9 but every time I download things on my s20 Netflix log its self off and delete my downloads why is this please help coz I love Netflix
I would love to purchase my subscriptions using Google store credit or and using phone billing would be very helpful
Major issues. Password wasn't changed but still can't log in when it's correct.
Good app but every time I switch off my tablet it uninstalls it's self everything else I have installed onto my tablet stays on it except from netflix
When it comes to animes they don't releasing full length animes. Suppose The anime has 4 Seasons Netflix releasing 2 seasons only
Good app but wish you could cast to a device without needing to have both of them be signed into the same account
The app completely stopped working please fix it otherwise its very good with good shows and movies
It is okay but you guys really need to work on the app jeez! It's so annoying and frustrating so pls work on it
"please add feature to report wrong subtitles, as I've many iterations of this problem which ought to be fixed"
I love the shows and movies but it can only have one person watching something and the other person can't but other than that I love this app
"The app its self is very good, but every now and then I get bugs were it won't let me watch anything"
Chromecast icon missing after update. Screwed up format again after update icons too close to the edge on tablet screen
"I didnt have problems until now , i cant open the app it says ""we could not reach the netflix server"""
it's a good app but it stops working almost always i have to uninstall and reinstall everytime.
The movie appolo 13 is not streaming properly. I experience a lot of interruptions.
It would be perfect if the app wouldn't sign me out anytime I tried to watch a show.
Can't watch downloaded movies offline. It keeps returning error message each time I tried to.
It use to bee good but now it's almost impossible to watch anything it always saying no internet but win I go to YouTube I don't have any problem
I wish Netflix had more contents.... for e.g: Insidious Chapters and I hate how content varies according to the country you're watching from.....
Love Netflix but app just doesn't load sometimes on my phone and am unable to watch anything for a week or 2
Have trouble with settings downloading and updating info but love the shows and will continue to subscribe.JC
"I thought I would have more movies and shows to choose from? the app is a bit confusing now, it was better before."
"Three start for now, cause i still not yet log in netflix ,and thats the problem , step 3 is my problem it always said "" sorry ,something went wrong""üôÑ i check already my net.,"
It's generally good but it has some bugs. The app won't open at all anymore for me for a while now.
I love this app I just wish that they would bring back stuff like Doctor Who and actually make some of the animes in English instead of only Japanese
The app sometimes just doesn't open on my phone. I need to reinstall it to make it work.
The reason I gave you three stars is because well I keep having to sign up again and again and again and again I'm getting bored of that so if Netflix producers if you get to read this note change that I have to keep sign again and again and again and again!
I like this app but alot of good shows got took down so when i got it was kind of dissapointing when i was little i loved pokemon and half the series was gone
Good site. Rather watch thru website on phone also instead of being forced to download app to watch shows
"Always error occured when open it, then I have to disable and enable again when I want to open it"
"As much as I love using the service, it dies drain the battery quite quickly."
I started watching friends and when I was on s3......there are no more videos available after that!!!!!üò´
"Having trouble connecting app to phone. Also when subscription expire, we must redownload the movie again..."
Frustration from last 5 days any show just keeps loading can watch trailers but not the show what's happening please fix it
Limited viewing unfortunately. No cbs series available and very limited number of movies so real bummer...
Im getting signed out on android when I fast forward. Whats the deal? Dont wanna have to switch to hulu.
Can't fast forward or would be a 5
Its an okay app but i have started to watch stranger things and i save to my playlist thingy and when i tried to go back an watch it.GONE.
why the content differs from a country to another I wish u to fix this problem because there is a lot of things I can't find in my country.
"Everytine i leave netflix and again comeback it opens first epoisode not where i left, its annoying, earlier it was not happening."
It desires a 3 like i just found out there is season 4 for a series i watch i found it on YouTube like y give all countries all seasons a same time
I can't watch HDR videos even with premium account and HDR capable phone. YouTube and Amazon Prime Is Supported But Why Not Netflix?
I don't know why but this app crash 5-6time out of every 10 time.Please fix this otherwise it ruining the experience.
Its a great app but everyonce and a while it will say that i can not watch this title and then i pick another one and it does the same thing
I like this app but When I watched flash and supergirl it there isn't season 7 flash and season 5 supergirl. my Region is in Indonesia
Option to listen without video disappeared. Please bring it back.
New update why can't I remove the shows I have watched as I used to in previous versions and I am talking about your app for android
No way to delete the watch history from app. I have to delete the history via web browser.
Three because the app is totally awesome but the subtitles should be on a black background
NETFLIX not responding
"Ita the most amazing app i have ever used for streaming moves and series, i was just hoping for more options soon"
"When I open the app, I always waiting it loading and can't view the page in my phone...Can fix this problem?"
takes to long to put on the new seasons they could just put out each episode the day after it comes out.
"other than having problems downloading, etc. it has some great showes and a few good movies"
"Just updated today. When tried to forward/backward 10s, it lagged..before resume."
It was great at first but now it doesnt even open just stays at the loading screen please clean this bug
"Every time I choose to watch Netflix, I have to go through the whole process. Very annoying!"
What did you do with this latest update? As of this morning Netflix won't go landscape on my phone anymore.
Why even High download quality so low. Sonyliv has perfected it. Please learn from them and provide proper download quality options in fhd/qhd formats also..
"I watch it just fine on my wii u but on my phone, whenevrr i try to watch a show or movie, the screen goes way dark"
Works best but i do not do not find any options to improve my video quality and there should be watch history section
"I really hope that you add a playback speed feature. Please, please, please üôè thank you!!"
"Stop taking everything off netflix . Stop taking the classics off . Netflix Za doesn't even have 10 things I hate about you , I am legend or American assassin . It's not fair to pay the price every month for a netflix account and then not having anything to watch anymore . Put some of the good movies on for the South Africans . And put supernatural on too please . Everybody on instagram from america and south africa is asking for it . We South Africans are just getting really dissapointed"
I've Xiaomi Redmi note 4 and now Netflix app is showing that it's not compatible in my phone. What I can do now??? Pls do something
"The search function and the suggestion movies/series show almost the same, noting new almost the same movies"
"Will not let me change profile. Keeps saying ""error changing profile. Try again later"" and this has been going on for weeks now"
Way too many notifications telling me what shows to watch. So off putting when apps do that.
The new next episode feature kinda sucks.. it looks like the YouTube one but doesn't work as well
It should have more movies and series because the premium subscription is expensive.
I dont like new update on app. Old oversion is good for user. It is difficult to find content
"After updating, frequently getting stuck and audio sync is lost"
"Hey there are many ways to pay for the subscription please add mpesa to the payment methods, to those of as in Kenya, and I will definitely get my subscription"
"three stars because it has three star shows, and even some of the classics are missing."
Netflix needs a lot update in Microsoft store it is hard to watch in big screen such as laptops. please do something
"actually I love it but I hate the fact that we need to sign in again every after update, it's annoying..."
The content offered in NZ is far less than what all other countries are offered. 3/5 Netflix
PIP(picture in picture) is not working on my device. It suddenly stops working.
And never wants to load and it's not my phone because I have a new phone and it doesn't have a lot of the movies I like and it doesn't get new ones very often
"Don't like the brightness control on the actual app, and needs Friends back on the app."
I can't get picture- in- picture to work. I have that permission clicked on and it still won't work. Does anyone know why?
its very useful but im disoppointed in how they delete my favorite movies/shows. Like good burger/mean girls/home/jessie and much more pls bring them back
It shows screen sharing everytime on the shows that are in continuance but if u start a new show that works...
Netflix has good show but i wish i can adjsut the brightness of the app.. it hurts my eyes when i watch for 15mins..
Half of my list got disappeared last night while i was watching the good doctor. Now i can't even find that show and all the Korean dramas are gone too Solve this issue asap.
"It's ok but not got a lot of films that I have search for, and not a lot of, ""recently added' as a good choice"
"It's abit buggy, the picture won't show or the app closes itself, or crashes"
Recieve a lot of problem while opening and it takes a lot of time to start the application
I like Netflix EXCEPT you should be able to turn off shiws/movies that are not in your language so they stop appearing
"I have the write info and it wont let me log in. I have it loged in on my laptop, but when i try and log in the app tells Me ive put it in wrong."
It yas some fun shows but I wish it had a little more anime plus it took twice the amount of money it was supposed to
"For the anime selection , the series is not finished for eg. The seven deadly sins sesson 2 and 3 is not updated"
Always not responding when im trying to open it. It tooks 5 to 6 times before i can watch furtherly.
"Latest update is giving me issues when watching on my phone. Never a problem before, they should to look into this."
"This is actually worth 5 stars but I only gave 3 because of lacking animes, i would really appreciate it if you would put Naruto Shippuden."
somewhat complicated to watch my movies i was just watching...but needs to add more shows and movies
Ok I love this and all the things/series/movies but I would love for vampire diaries all episodes and seasons back on Netflix plz and if you have that on there I'll reconsider my 3 star into a 5 star thank you
good service obviously but has been dropping good shows and investing on its own hit or miss productions rather than other goid movies and shows
"The pricing is too high, please try to lower it or people will continue to watch Netflix via unfair means like cookie trick and etc"
It's good....but.....plz put totally spies back on plz and don't change anything about them or the episodes if do those things then five starsüåüs
"This is a very good app, it feels very good to run it, but there is some problem in payment, there is a slight deficiency in it."
I have netflix subscription but when I login in my account then I can't show anything and showed welcome back..
There are not much good choices apart from Stranger things witch is rated M13+ and Titans witch is rated MA15 + and Transformers both the movies and the shows.
it's takes to long to load make it load faster and make it rotate sideways and make it work smoothly please do it
"The app: Good.. The Content: Big quantity but mostly not watchable... not suitable content and ideas like LGTB, Nudity..."
"I love Netflix, but I would be much more satisfied if the PIP feature didnt keep crashing"
"For some reason, the app doesn't want to connect to my smart tv.... Fix this and i'll give you ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
"Why i can't change my email account i tried several times but the error keeps saying ""something went wrong try again later"" is there any support available to assist me please?"
A lot movies not in Netflix. Would be great if in description awar that movie is not in English.
This app says every movie is on Netflix no there not all on it all the latest movies are nlt on it but rather than that its fine
I rated it 3 stars ONLY because they keep taking out my favourite show AND ofc it has to be almost all the power rangers. Its getting garbage by the day!!
Its not letting me watch movies or tv shows on my phone everytime i try to watch anything i really wanna watch the screen is black
It worked great at first .. but then it started to black out on my phone in the WiFi wasn't the problem
The app keeps on having issues every couple of days for which i need to force stop the app to work it smoothly
I have problem with downloading videos. It's not played If phone restart.its show only loading sign when I play
"Not a great selection for my type of shows, not sure if I'll keep after the free trial"
I love watching netflix.the only reason why i gave 3 stars because they don't have the complete episodes and seasons of NCIS..this show is one of the reason why i purchased Netflix..
"Will y'all please, for the love of the gods, stop cancelling shows (like Cursed, VWars, ext.) It's very disheartening and I'm very close to cancelling my subscription for it..."
So for some reason it wont let me watch it on my phone it just just keep loading for like ever I even have the wifi on..
New update of Netflix is not working on my android phone since last evening.. please kindly do something...
Need more scary movie n less seasonal episodes! Just something good to watch each week!
Need more improvements. Need a separate settings for HD & FULL HD.
I can't download on my netflix app because it's not showing my sd card as an option for download location.What do i do? Netflix should please do something about it.

I love Netflix a lot of movies can be watched but sometimes doesn't give you the exact movie you want
Mediocre. To many foreign films for me. You should be able to opt in or out. Simple solution. I'd be happy with that.
Dear Netflix please make some easy process of payment from all kinds of digital payments don't stuck on your some limited payment systems of limited banks
Every time I open this on my smart tv and my Samsung s10 plus phone it keeps showing up as if I have a network issue üôÑ
"i would have rated this prrfect if it actually worked, it is constantly crashing and shuttiong down on my device"
playback speed will be a great feature and one should be able to change playback quality during playback
Recently upgraded to android 10 and this app switches off my phone as soon as i click on a video. Need refund
Very limited films and TV series. But work well. Just not much to watch.
"I like netflix the disappointing part is, Not alot of anime pls focus on the anime too there is just so less even famous anime or new is not here."
I would rate this 5 stars if when ever I go on it and have not been on it for a day or so then I have to delete this app and reinstall it.
Frst release Hindi or English audio version of all C J T and K drama...then release English audio version of salaar and animal whatever or whichever film u want...
"At first it was exciting to watch series and movie but later it became boring no new series (GOT)or new movie (average infinity,X-Men ).... please make sure updated new movies or series thank you"
some movies don't have malay subtitles.. many friends close their accounts because there are no malay subtitles. the account has to be paid every month.. can't even solve the subtitles?

Pretty expensive and yet lots of good movies i wanna watch is not available in ph. Very few good movies and lots of really oooold movies
"Recent update causes downloaded videos cannot be watched without internet, the very reason I subscribe. Going to unsubscribe soon."

Netflix is a really good app but why are you so behind time? You dont even have after on this app. And this app keeps kicking me out
Sometimes English subtitles in large fonts will overlapÔºåno such problem before update

Good shows but it takes long after their release to come to Netflix and there isn't great movies on there
I loved this app before.But all of the series are incomplete.They do not contain all episodes.It's a drag.Why should I pay money for those half and unfilled episodes.
Great app but lately it does not want to load. Takes forever. There should be a new update
I like it but right now im being told to many devices but i clicked sign out all devices then signed back in and it still told me to many devices
I like it but hate it won't show other shows when the one you've watched is over automatically.
movies and episodes I started watching and paused start playing from the beginning when I get back to them

"I hate that you have that device cap now. I share an account, and because I wanted Netflix on my tablet, I can't use it on the laptop."
There is some problem with the app it will lag sometimes when I play a movie but other then that it's alright I guess?

They barely add anything new in they do it's garbage our just a waste of time that need to add more stuff.
"Sometime this app doesn't open, i have to restart my phone just to open this app, this problem occurred after last update"
You should work more on your subtitles very disappointed üòû didn't expect this from the biggest platform like so called Netflix üòè
I wish some of the shows or movies that previously showed stayed on instead of being removed.
I don't just like what is happening i mean how can i open the app then later it will now tell me Unfortunetly netflix has stopped open app again
In some countries they have more shows and movies than other countries which I find odd

"It's cool, But, They take away a lot of movies that I love, they couldn't just leave the movies there, there would be no problem"
Good I have always liked Netflix. Now with this pandemic we all are watching alot of movies at home.
From last two weeks it's not working properly whenever I try to play something the video starts breskinv in green blocks
Finger print option also include in Netflix app. Digit pin is old and slow
"I wish it has not only one Month purchase but have option to purchase for 2,3,4,5,6,7,etc months ...."
I would love to have more TV shows and Movies Netflix feels like a one time experience contents are restricted location wise
"There is no way to reorder the list. To make it worse, the list seems to be randomly sorted?!"

I can't change the country i am in to verify my new bank card. Also you can't change the currency. I travel a lot so it will be helpful to pay in the local currency not the original currency
Beings that I pay for service it's unfair when I hit 2gb of data I have to take hours to watch one hour it pauses and crashes.
"Please allow users to hide the games, I don't want to play / see them"
Netflix is okay it was going down road now to pricey to everything is going on on on I feel like Mike Fisher work with Disney plus start working with someone else where you at now
"Love the app. Needs to have newer releases, Everything is old. I use it for cartoons and show for my son"
"Stop asking who's watching, I don't have multiple profiles on my account. I have one profile, when I open the app just open with my one profile"
"my list does not load completely, the red circle keeps revolving mid list and can not go through complete list."
it is so fun easy to use and to download but the problem is the app doesn't allow to take screenshots that's why i gave it a 3 star
I cant open my netflix app... It always show me to choose my account but than it going out from the app.
The reminder button in my app doesn't work. Missing out on watching a lot of stuff this way.
The app doesn't show the movie background so l won't know if l downloaded the movie l want until l tap on it...but the app it's self it's amazing
Cool app but the only issue is the fact that it freezes at a point during the watching process its so annoying
Great app but theres a bug where when i watch Netflix the screen is just black only audio
when i push audio lyrics it takes out somewords so if they are speaking a different language i cant understand.
"App is good but, forward video with10 second stuck in this new update. Its worse exp."
"Love ‚ù§ the movies üé¨ because you can enjoy üòâ watching üëÄ them in your own time ‚è≤ and select any movie üé¨ you like, love ‚ù§ it."
Like this app...but I was a little dissapointed beccause My number is not allowed to pay. Acctually it's my first time to download this??? That's it I really really like it that's why I give for this app...
I love that it has all possible movies and it has a cycle but when the internet is slow the graphics changes into a blurr
I love the app but why is some things not complete? I dont know if its on other movies but in Fairytail theres only 1 SEASON can you add more? If not I could understand :) thank you
Can't wait to pay 16 euro a month for a limited choice of movies and series with more disappearing each year
it doesn't have all the shows/movies that you want to watch and it is blurry sometimes
"Over all the app is good but it doesn't have my favorite series HARRY POTTER PLEASE GYUZ ,,, WE WANT HARRY POTTER ALL THE PARTS ON NETFLIX IN HD QUALITY ."
Well.I would think it is fun.The reason why I did not rate it to five is because its kinda boring.When I try to find something Its pretty hard.But I still like Netflix.
Can't even unstall this app which just great and the good movies that are put on their get replaced within a 1year it's been out
Good app but its missing some movies and shows that I wanna watch and it takes forever to download.
Sometimes it shows that Netflix is not responding to the WiFi so it's a tad frustrating üòë
"it's good, but why can't i cast netflix on my phone to my smart tv? it's all black, i can't see anything."
Please fix your subtitle board ... The Black thing so much disturbing. It's cover the actors faces. Please back old subtitle graphics.
A 3 because now i can't sign in in my acount because i have to pay and i thought android phones can use netflix without paying
i really hate that expiration when you download some series or movies. what's the point of the download then?
"Critical issue - pause video, wait to auto lock mobile, video resume in background on locked mobile, we can here sound, oneplus 7 android 11"

"Since the latest update it won't cast to any of my devices, I can cast to all of them from YouTube so it's not my devices or phone, it's this recent update ü§î"
"I've been downloaded more than 30 episodes, but it always error 2.119 --"" it sucks"
Video player is crappy...video getting shattered and paused again and again when i forward it.
"They take to long to add new stuff and you have to pay a lot of money every month, just so you can keep watching."
"Keep closing on its own, can't even watch a good movie without closing on its own, fix it please"
"Netflix is very good, we can watch it a good movies but the we can't found the film after watching"
This app does not renew but cancel the best shows ever made.My favorite show Warrior Nun has been cancelled after just 2 seasons and I feel its terribly cruel.They really should stop creating and leaving stories untold especially if it is about the LGBTQIA+ community
Brightness become very low on my OnePlus and if want to increase it than also it isn't increasing over app.
Netflix is great but it usually isn't fair for people in different places where some people have harry Potter and others don't which makes people bored since they wanna watch different movies.
They said netflix is free on weekend...but it isnt so....netflix was about to be free for 5th and 6th december...
"Excellent app, BUT please improved the app Its almost 3 weeks I can't open this up because of error.. Blablablabla.."
"Multiple shows and movies have been given lower age ratings than what they actually are. ""Naruto,"" a well known anime series, is actually rated PG-13, whereas Netflix has it rated TV-PG. Another film called ""Expelled from Paradise,"" rated R+ for good reasons, is said to be TV-14 by Netflix. This streaming service would have been an easy 5-star review if not for this key flaw."
It's a good app but I'm currently experiencing a problem where when I pause whatever I'm watching i am unable to resume watching it
Don't understand. New releases show the past releases from 2019???? And binge watch again section does not make sense.
App doesn't load on mobile internet. 4g I have and still face this issue. Content wise no complaints.

"i wish i could rate you a full 5, but after my recent visit to the UK, I realised that Netflix is Cheating Africa in content and updates.

Its a nice app bt some of the movies like myself i like anime bt there arent any of which i want to watch. Even the netflix originals
Love netflix but netflix should create different lists. One list for what u wanna watch and one list of ur fav things to watch.
I give it thumbs up due to how convenient the app is and how u can have offline access but thumbs down for not updating more often
I use to love Netflix until I discovered Tubi!! Top quality as is Netflix however it is totally free

well its pretty good but the thing that i only gave 3 stars is because that it doesn't show the cut off head that...i hope you guys will fix it thank you..
Netflix should make a list of the movie/drama/tv show that will be delete a week or a month before.
"has a few good shows, but if it loads only. can watch 6 episodes then the others wont load"
Awesome series & content.... but to improve Indian Subscribers...you have to add top 5 regional languages as a subtitles....then u vl get More subcribers
"i love Netflix but some movies are not available please add new movies classic movies like now and then,the thirteenth year i thought i could find them but I couldn't pls make these available I'm begging please thenks"
Overall Netflix's pretty good except for the cancellation of shows mid-way.
New+hot tab auto-plays the videos even though I have that option disabled in the profile's settings.
When I enter the password and I am sure of it it says that the pasword is incorrect otherwise it is an very entertaining app
Would be a 5 star but some shows that are on my TV aren't showing up on my android phone so I can't continue watching them wherever
All the movies from other countries are sub titled. Need more in dubbed English.
not very many famous titles which is not a good look for a movie company but other than that it runs very well
Bug when playing/pausing UI not disappearing preventing full screen.
Netflix should make it to where you download the whole season not just each episode in the season

Used to work very well but nowadays it is just showing loading and not showing what I want to see

I can't get the latest movies on here even tho Google says it's available for netflix kinda frustrating
Just make the payment system easier. Like add payment with paytm or phonepe than it will be great
Why most of the movies are not available in our country? Overall amazing entertaining app.
This app is is okay though I hate how they got rid of the stuff I used to watch and how you search for stuff is ok enough to use.

Don't know what happened but can't watch anything after the last update even though the audio is getting played
I hope they make it much easier to search using what LANGUAGE of a video that you want to watch.
"Need to watch more serious and movies, I don't understand why can't watch some movies and series (Ireland) do to my geographical area."
Remove ready for re-watching . Also add some good comedy shows and give option for genres
The main problem is the lack of subtitles. Only English subtitles can be selected from the menu.
Home page layout keeps changing and so annoying because there always a new problem each time it's changed
"I tried to pay my bills but the system keep on saying ""..you have problem on paying method..."" Now I can't watch movies now.."

"Movies r old n u can hardly find any good movies that hv been out for a while like ""Sex and The City"", ""Unfaithful""...? Not sure why? However, Netflix series are definetly very good i love that section they offer."
I love Netflix but I don't want it on my phone. It came pre-installed and won't let me uninstall.
Netflix is amazing but the shows on there aren't as amazing as Netflix itself without the vampire diaries
The shows are good but it keeps signing me out of Netflix can you fix this please.
The way the app is set up is very old fashioned. Time for them to reinvent themselves
You used to have a lot of faith based movies and now there only maybe two handfuls if that but alot of I mean alot of other sexually explicit and other kinds of violent movies....would greatly appreciate an update and bigger selection of faith based content.

I'm being sent foreign and international films there has not been any updates on new movies.
Why you're showing screen limit repeatitively when I'm only the user of this account ? Fix this Netflix.
Getting black screen. Only audio and subtitle. Fix it please
Its good but find a way to keep shows instead of just removing them.
"App usually works great, and some great shows but recently I can't get onto the app at all"
Great app but since updating I get an error stating 'error locating billboard'...how can I fix this?
Good app just please make the library open to every one because there are things i cant watch because of my location and thats stupid
Don't have more famous memes movies and Hindi dubbed anime content is less and playback speed is not at 2x
When a new movie comes out Netflix takes to long to add it to there app
App is not working bith on my anroid nd tv from 2 days it has connection problems while other apps are working properly on my Internet connection
The shows are variety but always have problems to open after updates.
"I love Netflix, but South Indian languages content are very lessüòû"
Just love it hate that my country gets less shows but I still use it so I rate it 3 stars for not giving my country more shows like in America
Very good app because i can watch all type of movies i desire without any interferance...
"Oy put some black heighlights in text translations, you cannot see it when the background is white"
There is a stupid glitch where either the screen freezes but it still plays or my screen turns black fix this dumb issue
"some good shows. but seems like 75% of the shows is focus on sex, no good story lines, are undesirable English speaking shows. And no I am a AA woman married to a White man so don't come to me with that racist stuff. much love!"
Enjoy it but the movies are limited and sometimes even with limited movies they still have trouble loading
Netflix is gr8 except should have more shows and not remove seasons and movies !
"Would be great to have the ratings feature back, but overall good experience."
Good app but lost all my download after update was done and still old downloads occupy space even though not seen in app.
"They should put infinite episodes on your favorite tv shows, movies, and animes!! And shoudnt be so expensive!!"
Please make all movies and series can be accessed in any country. We are in pandemic situation how can you still give country restriction.
"It's good, but it has a limited variety of Korean dramas."
I think Netflix should give a choice to manually stop or cancel automatic sub plans without cancelling one's membership.
"I love this app, but only because some show aren't available in some countries I dislike it."
"Poor quality on Xperia 1. This mobile is 4k capable, but I only get HD quality, even if my plan is 4k and my Internet speed is 100mbps"
The mini player that pops up when you press the home button is not working properly won't let me touch it or turn it off
"Great app, one of the best mobile app ever but poor content from my point of view. Too boring and steril movies"
Whenever i would watch a series it would always put me one episode behind when i exit it but other then that its a great app
"Doesn't load all the time, no matter how strong ur connection is, only thing to fix"
"Why can netflix work with dex or basic screen mirroring, us in rural areas what to use mobile device for most thinga."
It has everything expect what i want to watch üòî
Doesn't have as many popular movies & TV series as I thought it would with purchasing a monthly membership.
This app is useless after the last update! It doesn't show where you left series..
I like Netflix but most movies have alot of sexual scenes they also need more movies loaded because they put one or two movies per month which sucks
Currently the smurf they didnt show the season 2 i was waiting like 4 weeks.. sooo.. i gave it a three i rather change it to 5 stars when it had season 2..
"Amazing app, terrible (or the lack of) patchnotes. Come on I want to know what I'm downloading."
It's not fair that if you're from a different region you dont get to watch the good series and movies
Download always stuck. It should have a feature to automatic resume download.
It is ok. Lots if repeats and miss directions of movie titles.
It's a good service I would just like it if I didn't have to uninstall it in order to stop screen casting.
Not able to download.So far i was using it. Uninstalled it couple of mins back and now unable to install it.
I like that you can watch almost every show but the get rid of some that I absolutely love:(
"Its good but there not completing series on certain shows and I wanna see more good shows like The Jellies ,Dragon Ball Z and Super, Naruto Shippuden , Yu Yu Hakasho , Attack on Titan , My Hero Academia and Please bring back American Dad and Family Guy"
Need to add more movies and TV shows I had to watch American Horror Story season 9 1984 on Hulu and they have ads
It used to work but now I'm for some reason I just get stuck on the loading screen so I can't watch Netflix
Has a great way for watching movies but needs more of a choice of movies.
I cant see all the movies when i connect it to my tv plus not all the good movies are on here.
Can't get it loaded on my phone since yesterday for some reason. On laptop works well.
Very difficult to cho0se movies and shows when there are no decription anymore!!!!!
"I will change the review if I got a reply. I need the viewing activity in the app, not in the browser. Thank you."
Ive sent another email asking how I can access the account details for me to register and receive the full payment. There are several ways you can prove that it was indeed built on my own namesake. Making it my family. Please get back to me with the information for the bank.
Iike Netflix I pay for Netflix but now when I watch its edited when some is cussing for example it bleeps it out that never did that before
New update isn't so great! S8 + Chromecast isn't working so hot anymore!
Terrible user interface. Waste so much space on the preview video window.
Have fun watching the movies of my choice but some times it poses to much and you miss the move.
My picture in picture stopped working since a couple of days and yes the pip permission is on. What gives?
"the new updates stink, i try watching on my moto z3 and every 30 seconds it goes from full screen to tiny screen in the corner :("
This app has been perfect before know wvery time i open the app on my phone the go to my ipad it says something like my list issue or sum
whenever i changed my account photo to something it doesnt show and barely horror movies if they had a few halloween movies that would make it a 5/5
"Well... The app is awesome but, I wish there was a ""restart"" option on the app like when its on the tv..üòëüòë"
"It was working fine but now i can't even open the app on my phone, updated it and still nothing is happeningü§î"
Its a good app i will give it that but the prices keep rising and my favorite tv shows keep getting cancelled and that just blows
"why since the latest update, many times when im watching its only audio n subtitles but no video?please help?"
I loved streaming on my phone but since the new update u find it difficult to watch movies and TV series because of the darkness
"Pls upgrade your series. Some series have up to season 7 or 8. But for a long time, they stopped at season 6"
It doesn't change anything if you change the maturity option literally nothing at all happens when it's changed
I like this app bit while I was watching naruto shippuden I got to season 10 episode 25 and it's supposed to go up to season 17. Why only go half way when you can show the full show with all season it's not fair to the people who pay to use this application. I wanted to see the end of naruto shippuden where naruto and hinata get married but you scammed me making me pay all this money just so you can cut my show off at season 10üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
"Okay app, uninstalled because they made the subscription only work for people in the same home."
"Its good of course but, PUT FREAKS AND GEEKS BACK WHAT WERE YOU THINKING OF WHEN YOU TOOK IT OFF?!!! Just. put it back"
The new UI is the worst update there is. Please bring back the old UI
"Very slow app, almost useless for interactive content."
"Good programs shame you can't change the tariff you pay in the app, the only way is on line don't make any sense"
I just updated my Netflix and I can't open it. When I try opening it keeps on closing
Netflix needs to get on board with Theta to speed up buffering.
"Better than watching TV. Hopefully stays away from politics. I hope after my update, I'm still enjoying Netflix!"
"Great app but doesn't work on my new phone, gets stuck at loading for every video."
The new update has problems when viewing downloaded content while offline it keeps closing and failing to start on huawei y5 2019
It's pretty decent I just wish there were more shows or the shows wouldnt end on a short season like some of the animes
Trying to upload a movie from my phone to the tv.. doesn't always have the icon.. really annoying me now..
"I love Netflix, but they need to add some older kid shows for kids to enjoy."
"Some good stuff not much else. very little real life things, mostly realty or fantasy base."
Great streaming app would be 5 star but is way to expensive now compared to other streaming apps now considering cancelling
loved it until I was watching Riverdale and apparently season 3 and 4 are not available!!I searched Google and their was no hint about It so please reply
It does not play downloaded items offline. It disapponiting. Otherwise other functions are fine.
Good online streaming app with large pool of content. But costly subscriptions ....

The brightness is dim af still after maximizing the brightness slider on video sidebar.
Well Netflix is nice and all but really putting Anime that I have already watch at facebook there not even trending now why would you do that

After update this app is not opening.i have taken the premium for 1month from which 1day is wasted because of this.please fix this problem asap
There should be an option to cancel auto renewel. And also payment through upi should made available.
it's too slow but whe√± you have enough data it's fine but especially when it comes to download it's so slow
I'm not sure why but my dimmer/brightness adjuster seems to have stop working in the app on my Samsung S22
Will give a 3 stars atm because movies arent updated.like some have a season 3 that came out way mid last year and still not available.

"Hey Netflix, stop asking me if I'm still watching after almost every other episode. Just play.. And play. If I'm done, I'll turn you off don't worry!"
"Good app, but I'm facing problem 5.10 a lot where movies just won't play!! Still same issue"
Good but library needs to improve for Asia Pacific. Also too many Adam Sandler movies.

Recently I update my Netflix then after its not opening ü§¶üèªl loss my all movies. What I need to do? To open again my account
So expensive for India . Every one cannot afford currently Netflix plans. If you reduce plans price then more user joined & u get more profit
I really do like Netflix the only problem is there is not alot of anime to watch on Netflix
Ok app but not much good series.(recomended) modern family and friends.not many great films they do add some but no that much so it's ok
"Didn't expect this from Netflix, could have been better, Amazon is doing much better than Netflix"

"Got a brand new Chromebook and Netflix ""Isn't compatible."" How is that even posssible?"
I have updated and subscribed for the app.But app is not responding..facing difficulty in opening the app.

"this application is is good but we need some more latest movies(Bollywood+Hollywood) like thor Ragnarok, avangers latest part etc... and also improve search option."
"Always unable to connect despite clearing cache, stable Internet connection and updated application."
The app is great! The price increase every couple of months sucks though!
"Impressive, but sometimes it just clashes and I won't be able to sign in.It should be fixed."
This app is good. The only problem is that there is a fee when you watch a movie. But I recommend this app to those who have money. That's what you're waiting for. Download it now !!!
What's wrong with this new update. The minimum brightness is too bright. Can't watch at night. Please fix it.

I would of rated it five if i could like add pokemon journeys I've been waiting for it to come on UK Netflix for a few weeks please put it on there.
Latest update hid the cast button on the home page. It's inconvenient.
Good app to watch only the Netflix originals. Many movies are not there.
Unable to continue to watch movies or shows left in middle..
Could update content faster as there is very rarely something new and interesting to watch
Had to uninstall the app because it won't open. Now I'm having problems downloading the app

"My data download has been pending since yesterday ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è... Generally, it was a great app before I temporarily uninstalled it"
after the update the downloads are not playing properly. it says some problem in opening
The app is great. But when it says you have to update it takes 1 to 2 hours to finally update.
Hard to navigate on my Android phone and chromecast doesn't always work
only 3 becuase only one person can watch a show at a time and the only way for more then one phone to watch is if u pay 13 $ like
"A really great app but it has deleted my downloads before I even watch them ,that is the only problem i have with the app"

Only plays with my Hotspot when I have my alloted 15 gigs. I have no issue with Amazon after my 15 is gone.
I am facing issue with opening the account as it is getting stuck on Netflix logo! Do help!

Hard to find stuff you want to see. Uses a lot of phone battery when casting.
it needs better movie selection a lot of the shows look like independent films
1. I can't pot the movie 2.l can't tear net to Arabic
3 stars. I loveeeee this app. But I don't like something. Why would you ever deleted The Little Pretty Liars? Huh? I hate you for this. I mean whyyyy. I am not the only one. This serial is my fav from all the times. I love it!!! And you destroy everything! Badddd
"I can't update my email.. When i try to save the new email Its said , 'sorry, something went wrong, please try again later' Later on i already try but still the same result please fix it,"
They need to ask me to pay subscription When my subscription finished they should stop removed from my personal account Very bad that was why I removed it Netflix from my phone den ...
when it update i can't get to download anything properly when i press on the movie it only shows the preview.
Overall good but there are many problems in download so it's not good for offline viewing
Unnecessory subscription is the major issue with this app. Else a good place to spend time
neflix is great but they do need to pdate what they have to watch hey barely add new movies and shows and if a ne season is out they never have it
"It was amazing but there's a glitch while I'm watching movies, kindly please fix it, thank you!"
Must run constant updates which if u dont effect ur experience! Otherwise a great app.
Could be a more variety of shows and allow you to actually find videos you are looking for.
"Unable to connect it says, Sorry, we could not reach the Netflix service. Please try again later. (-1001)."
nice app but a bit lame because there are so many old movies and the new ones every month are too few..
Amazing but i put 3 stars cause it dosent show alot of movies you want disney+ is better just saying but this app is still amazing
Bad image quality
While coming back to app from other video we have to restart the app. Earlier that was not the case.
Pretty tired of the app starting me two to three eps back every single time i go to continue a show.
I couldnt search some tv shows that other acct have...like the 100 series my friends can see it but when i tried searching on my acct no result
Why do the subtitles just come on? also its been closing down a couples times during an episode or movie
"You guys need to upload new movies. The ones you have are old ones , most of them I already seen them . I still use it though until I find something better."
"Before this was all right, but it suddenly stop my auto payment. And if i try to continue it doesnt work. Now i cant even pay when i want to?"
If they had more variety as well as consistent offers that would be great.
Please give the option to arrange the items we chose on the my list because it takes a lot of time to find a movie or show we want to view at the moment
Needs to support other phone ratios with Notches like the OnePlus 6 need to be able to watch movies in fullscreen
Hi it's good but sometimes it just freezes and I can still hear adio I would give it a 5 star if it didn't do that
Always crash..always error..I am so dissapointed..I pay for it to watch but its always error
they need to get some more movies on that people want to watch and definitely more TV shows
i wish you had more anime options and that you could pick the language and not have to use subtitles
"The app is nice but when you download movies and leave it for long, it will disappear"
"I like this but the only Issue is I had PIP picture in picture mode was not working, I tried everything and Im using android 10"
"The game is very good.but please add more features like guns, cars,houses,etc"
Its very good but just one thing Netflix always deletes me child's favourite and than he can't watch it like paw patrol and oddbods
Please introduce two step authentication. Account getting hacked again and again even after changing password.
"App is not working properly, I have called Netflix explained the issue, still no response..."
it takes sooooo long to download and i have really good quality of wifi butttttt it still takes a day to download other than that i think it ok
Its ok but sometimes the audio messes up this app needs to fix alot of things but on the other hand its still good
The problem with this is many anime available in english dub outsidebut it's not on Netflix.
Be nice if it didnt keep freezing the image while playing the audio.

As for now my Netflix is always crashing down. Are you guys experiencing the same thing?
Its great but in the ankme seven deadly sins there is no season 2 or 3 that can be seen in the app when i open it please fix this
nice very easy to use and fast but Netflix has every movie except the one you search for
"Add newest movies . Your collection of moies is quite small , but anyway its a good app ."
Less user-friendly than other streaming apps. Needs more nuance in parental controls/kids profiles.
"Netflix got Some Issues When Playing the video, The video suddenly Got interrupted Fix The issue"
"To be honest im very disappointed why they removed the last air bender like why.... Im giving this 3 stars because they keep removing movies i like why do they even have ""american Netflix"" like what its extremely unfair because im not able to see all movies unlike the ""americans"" they can see the legend of korra. Its just a disappointment."
Everytime i open a program it displays a massage that this title is not currently availabale pleas try another title...

"Love the shows, Series And Content you guys provide but If my I dont have any internet connection why wouldn't I can't watch movie , series ,shows in download while be offline"
"After the last update, I wasn't able to open it again. It keeps crashing."
I mean it's fine but it's a shame that Netflix doesn't support themed icons like Starbucks and Disney+ do.
Please improve the font color of the subtitles. They can barely be read.
The app I good ig but I need to pay 20$ a month and there is not a lot of things I want to watch on here like Naruto Shippuden or Boruto
After scrolling the list if you select some movie and go back then app brings you back to the start of list

Very bad I was impressed when the Netflix say that the Netflix is free but it dont work it is scam Scam scam scam scam three star because it works only on money
There have no latest hit series of hindi which are popular. You take money for showing any kind of movies but giving facility is none.
Pretty good and it really functions well and keeps you updated on the trending news
Sudden glitches. Slow server. Can't download even when I have internal storage.
"SUPER irritaing that it askes ""who's watching"" upon opening, from the same and only device I use.."
For the past 4 weeks I'm not able to stream a single episode of Big Bang Theory. Please fix the bug.
It is good but some movies aren't on Netflix and other movies which are theu aren't there in complete seasons
they need mention the artist like Amazon Prime video nothing in detail is given about the series I need to search everything on Google Tu get information features on filters of also
Please make a feature that allows you to skip the intro to multiple episodes in series or binge session

it is really fun because you can see every movie you like even tho they take some movies off
I am giving 3 stars.. Because it need so many storage... You can just go for the NETFLIX WEBSITE... Website is better than app üëç
Very wide variety of shows but does not have all the seasons of many shows

I already paid my subscription today for October 4 - Nov 4 2022 can you help me.. I don't what to be scam. Can you please ducking help meeeeee
I can't watch other from Netflix so many from YouTube it will be in Netflix but I search and I can't found it from YouTube I look and ot was from Netflix studio bot it wasn't it plz fix this and boss baby family bassinets from Netflix I can't found plz fix this thing
Compared to other apps this one doesn't have nearly the same amount of movies/anime they need to put more in
After the recent update streaming lags and pauses more than often thus worsening the experience!
"Better if more details will be given like Audio Language, Genres in brief description page."
"I put 3 stars because all the series don't have ALL the episodes. It's just so annoying, Sorry. Truman"
Netflix is awesome but the problem is there not much movies on.
Not all old movies you get here...well Netflix need to work on that request of customer input too
Its good but I noticed that some seasons are not there when clearly its already out in other webs like the season 4 of BNHA
Super late update.specially series movies.like for ex.the 100.other sites already finish season 7 and in netflix.its season 5 for how many months?
"Haven't been able to get episodes to play back to back, if fixed I will give 5 stars"
Why i am unable to use rupay debit card for payment in the Netflix membership . Can i get any better update in this app
"I love the movies,but movies delay to appear only after a year like Fast 9 so when is it appearing on Netflix"
sometimes the screen just looks really bad and this is a good working chrome book
The progress bar and play/pause overlay will not go away no matter what I do. What a waste of money!
A cool app ...does wellwith android phones ...i lyk it ..and cool for watching movies during the weekends
Only a certsin amount of people are aloud on one time and sometimes it says there too many devices who has it when only 3 people in my BIG FAMILY has it .
I love it but its a bit pricy and some of the really good anime gets deleted or just movies in genural
App is crashing frequently. And this is ruining the show. Plz pix this otherwise telegram is there.
"Episodes stopped downloading . Everytime I try to download it , it shows some error"
Enjoy watching but cumbersome searching for what to watch. Worse than channel surfing.
The problem am having with app now is my downloaded video always getting deleted which I cannot explain the cause.
"fun to watch so much movie that we cant see at the movies nerfix is the best. netfix thank you.i love movies so that is good for me and it is free and no popcorn and snack you can get snack at your house and you can have kid movie,teen movie adult movie. even pet movie you are the best"
"I try watching the show ""The Ranch"" which is an original netflix show and it's really dark like the colors"
I love the way you can watch offline but i feel netflix should add more true films (gifted hands)
Netflix is great but the only problem I have with it is that not a lot of stuff comes out on it and it makes it boring
"Getting worst , updating now a days old movies which i have seen TV or other ott app before 2 years and new movies and web series not coming regularly"
When i try to make a new account and enter my code from the gift card it either says the code is invalid or we cannot process your request.Can someone give me a solution for this problem.
Most of the movies do not have speech only subtitles (Hungarian).
The app takes too long to load and ends up with an error message! Fix this.
If they keep upping the price and just adding old stuff it won't be worth it much longer.
It would be good if you put South Park whole seasons cause i really wanna finish it.. I would appreciate if you do that üòÅüòÅüòÅ

Everything is going well but only the part you didn't pay them it doesn't allow you to watch a movie or series sucks

"I dont have an updated version even After updating the app I am not able to change Room pin, Plans details etc plzz help"

"I love to watch the office on Netflix, but, you got rid of my all time favorite show. Skins UK! PLEASE BEING IT BACK. IM GOING TO DIE WITHOUT IT. I HATE YOU NETFLIX"
Sometimes everytime I'm watching a show it always show an error code 500.-1019 even though I already do what the guide told me to do

Why cant we adjust quality of video in this app......its just draining my data.......please do something about this.
I'm not able to view the cast button when I play any movies. Please assist.
Content is good but costly. Plan rates should be competitive to other OTT apps.
It's okay but the new movies you release are usually years old. Need an update.
I'd like it more if you would make it that when you download movies that it would end up in your gallery
i just wish that HBO will allow their shows/movies to be in Netflix as well.
it doesnt even have all of the seasons for some stuff like for naruto and demon slayer it just stops right in the middle of the seasons
Uninstalled due to recent changes. It was good while it lasted.
app is very good.But no recent movies or shows to offer!better watch them online thay pay for this.
Can you add more options in payment method in India Like you have PayPal in other countries We would also like option through paytm or payt

Always in there position
Regional differences. It would be great if we can access all contents nationwide.

Not as many good movies now that the other streaming services have gone head-to-head with them.
"Getting ""device failure occured. Please try again (500-117)"" error repeatedly while trying to launch the app"
The content is good but there is no freedom of choice of streaming quality of the video
Netflix is the best to me but i think Netflix still need to add more value to itself

Constantly crashing and restarting my phone ='(
nice but science friction and action movie latest release should be on netflix
I cant pick the quality of the video on mobile phone even though I have good internet
Not a bad variety of current and old movies/TV series
Why do there have to be certain shows in certain countries its so annoying
"It's not working well, after updating the application."
"not enough shows and updates, but the app is good."
It's good but it lacks current series and movies.
After latest updated getting screen blank only audio available
Please update anime ep latest. So slow. And latest movie around 2015-2020.
"Latest July update always says device error, asking me to restart my device. üëéüëé"
Too hang. Disney + Hotstar is running faster .
The only thing I hate about netflix is regionally locked content.
"Nice to use ,but the download space is too small"
"honestly it's super slow, and on my device it's not the best"
Must improve in some aspects like provide latest updates of movies options
I like it but there are just way too much old series and movies.
Sometimes they ask for restart due to some errors
It's okay just need to update the movies and TV shows more
On the tv it keeps closing the app when I try to watch something
"Lately, when I open the app it loads for a while and exits on its ownüòî"

Download is way slower compared to other streaming apps
Can't display in full screen mode on Oneplus 7.
It doesn't have such a great selection of anime nor movie selections
"Great.... but not many good new series, better than orie though (prime makes you pay for most movies)"
"It has been a huge source of entertainment. And I love it, please reply"
Thank you Netflix for entertaining us for 2 days...but kindly reduce the cost definitely we will take a membership ...

Keeps crashing everytime i try to watch a movie
It's not bad but if you go to search it may not have that show but apart from that it's fine.
"Is a good app but they need to add more animes, movies and series"
About 60% of the shows on here make me feel like my grey brain cells are dying. Great for some anime and classic movies maybe?
"We neeed watch party!! And a real ui ux for seen, liked and see later shows!!"
Works well when you have the better connection
The app is good but please will you add auto rotate in your app
Hi Netflix team Please add more tamil content and dubbed version of movies & series
Getting 5.7.1 error frequently after doing all troubleshooting not able to resolve
Not bad but you need more content evan bring back some of the old series like ghost whisperer
It freezes most of the time annoying
Before auto payment You must ask the person if he wants to subscribe it or not..you just deducted the money from account like thief
Netflix isn't responding error even after latest update
Netflix keeps recommending things that are not even close to what I watch so 3 stars
"Its good but its so lag that even the movies won't play.. Idk why.. Please, do something thanks"
"The app sometimes freezes when I first open it, and then I have to open it a second time in rest its ok"
awesome but it keeps on Taking alot to load then it says error
"Sweet, just not nearly Swwt enough... Thanks for asking, though. Nicole Katrina Lewis Prather"
"You guys are unbelievable, what's wrong in taking screenshots of a show we like? You are forcing us to find other ways and take measures that should not be necessary, all due to your ridiculous restrictions"
needs a bigger variety of options to choose from
Would be great if netflix wasnt disgusting or made good content more often
All good but subscribtion makes me think to leave Netflix.
content is amazing. Price is on the higher side.
"Why you are not updating 6months plans or 1 year plans . In that case Netflix can gain more subscribers know, but still you are not providing why?."
Once u watch most of the movies it starts to get boring
My screen would blink black and white everytime I watch a show on Android
Its average was expecting the latest movies and most are old ones.
Netflix is okay but you login and pay each month
"I cannot watch Netflix, it keeps telling me that there is a problem????"
Sometimes don't work but is a great movie program unless your offline
Some shows don't have all seasons and episodes
It's malfunctioning... Now it's getting really frustrating
"got mate 10 pro, should have hdr but dont have. upated to latest version and same."
Love it but wish some movies had all the seasons available
Good streaming app but content is very less!!!
What's stopping netflix to have 2x playback speed?
"It's great, but sometimes the image is blurry."
A lot of movies aren't on the app.. otherwise it's awesome
There is no option of speed up the videos.so i will give you 3 stars.
My daughter is really sad that you took off her my little pony shows that's 3 shows only So hopefully you will put it back
in the middle of watching a series and they removed it the next day
"I love the app. They offer a huge variety of programs. HOWEVER, they specify: ""black"" movies/programs and LGBTQ programs, in the line up. Where are the CHRISTIAN programs, the STRAIGHT-oriented programs, the HISPANIC programs, the ITALIAN programs and so on. God (oops, I said ""God"") forbid I have the courage to ask for Caucasian programs (although specifying black or LGBTQ is ok). Hey, how about DISABLED?? Do you see how designating your programming in this way is itself divisive?"
Very good. Keep increasing the cost for no good reason.
I hope netflix will support Samsung S7 Edge in HD playback
The app on the phone keeps crashing !
Last update i got black bar's with subtitle its so annoying
love the shows but its not fair how i cant watch something when my mom is watching a movie. Update that! I want to watch bunked and my mom wants to find good movies and its not fair that i cant watch my show and my mom cant either. So i give yall a three

"So you guys are actually gonna go through with it huh? Well, it was good knowing you Netflix. I'll never forget when you were king of the world. In a few years, you'll be this generation's block buster. They'll tell stories of you."
Netflix subscribtion is useless if u cant get a VPN subscribtion.
Can't seem to go back to old episodes or seasons.
its doesnot have sufficient Content like others Apps Where as hotstar have more content in less subcription charge if u guys take hoichoi Altbalji Hotstar and then take 1200 per subcrition charge then people will join money and buy suprction
